Weaknesses/Deep Lore Milkers - There's only one thing an ayylmao likes more than anal probing, and that's cows.

Their auto attack damage happens again at the end of the target creature's turn. When the creature is attacked by another creature, or is hit with a harmful AoE, this effect ends. The piranhas can also be forcefully ripped off with an athletics check as a standard action. Failure causes the creature to take the attack damage again immediately. At the end of a piranha swarm's turn, it loses 3 hp for each creature it uses its auto attack, representing the dwindling swarm cause by the tenacious fish clinging to their enemies. Sense Weakness - If a creature without a swim speed or athletics proficiency is detected by the piranha swarm, it gets a free dash action on its next turn. This ability also activates if a bleeding creature is detected. Weaknesses/Deep Lore Baited - While piranhas do attack living creatures, they prefer easier prey. If a dead carcass is within range of their blood scent, piranhas will tear it to shreds before moving on. Medium or small creatures distract for one turn. Anything smaller only uses their movement. Anything larger than medium distracts for 1 more turn per size category.

Special Attack: Tongue Lash - You can use your tongue attack on two creatures within 10 feet of each other. Weaknesses/Deep Lore Elite Tracking - Shirshu are practically extinct, with the few that still live existing in captivity. They are naturally gifted trackers and such talents are typically nourished by a knowledgeable captor. When presented with an item that has a creature's scent on it, very little can prevent the shirshu from finding its target. It can follow its scent across continents, under water, underground etc. If the creature currently exists on the same plane, the shirshu will follow the most direct path to reach this creature, usually informing its master of the general distance (within a mile, dozens, hundreds or thousands of miles) via gestures. If the target is dead, it will lead you to its body. If the target went to another plane, it will bring you to the portal (potentially allowing you to continue the chase) or its last location before teleporting. Other strange circumstances can also completely prevent a shirshu from smelling anything related to a creature. Only through repeated exposure to powerfully smelling chemicals (such as perfume) can a creature evade a shirshu's scent. Such exposure requires enough to fully submerge a creature, typically increasing its price 10x for medium creatures. You must submerge yourself in this fluid every day. You can also choose to make yourself smell rancid for a similar effect that instead lasts for a week, provided you don't clean up. Such a scent can easily be obtained via smearing yourself in fecal matter or taking a dip in a sewer, but you yourself are always sickened 2 while this persists.

Within a few days, the eggs are ready to hatch and they eat their way out of their host, forming a insect swarm, but it is large and has half as much hp.

If a creature rolls at least 32 on perception, they can push them to safety, treating them as though they noticed the fissures. This does not require an action and is intended to be used as an opener in place of stealth. Boss Actions - Usable 1/turn. Timber \\[recharge] - At the end of another creature's turn, take a bite out of a tree and cause it to fall in a direction of the wildfire dragon's choosing. This essentially functions as a line attack whose distance depends on the size of the tree. All creatures in this line take 4d6 (14) crush damage, are knocked down and entangled (reflex negates). The knockdown condition cannot be removed until the entangled is removed first.\\ Creatures can attempt to escape using athletics as a standard action. Dealing 30 damage to the tree is also enough to free a creature, or 15 slash or fire damage.\\ Cannot be used in consecutive turns (chew your food!).\\ Begone! - Use seismic setup at the end of another creatures turn.\\ Pin - Usable when a creature moves adjacent to a wall while within reach. The dragon makes a melee attack that deals tail damage and entangles the creature on hit. This entangle lasts until the wildfire dragon is no longer threatening the creature or it is poise broken.\\ Friction \\[fire] - If a creature within reach is currently entangled, a wildfire dragon can end the condition by dragging the length of its entire body against the creature rapidly. This automatically sunders the creatures armor (or shield if the creature chooses), deals 8d6 (28) slashing and fire damage and inflicts a unique T3 affliction. Melted Away - If Weaknesses/Deep Lore Boss Mechanic: Wooden Scales - A wildfire dragon has surprisingly soft and vulnerable scales, so it has developed a unique form of protection. It uses its magic to form a wooden scale exoskeleton on the outside of its body. As the wildfire dragon fights, it gives off heat which burns away these scales, leaving itself vulnerable, but giving it greater mobility. When a wildfire dragon reaches 210 hp, and every time it loses 50 more (160, 110, 60, 10), a layer of the scales explodes violently, activating scale shatter, decreasing the dragon's AC by 1, but increasing its speeds by 10. Healing past this threshold does not allow them to regain this AC or use scale shatter again. From the Ashes - Wildfire dragons must consume the ashen remains of creatures in order to replenish the protection from their wooden scales. They need a supplemental supply of ashes with their usual meals over the course of a week to regain 1 layer of scales. They typically bury themselves somewhere near their supply. Other Traits Ability Scores - Str +4, Dex +4, Lucc +0, Int +1, Wis +1, Cha +0 Dragon Senses - Echolocation (30 ft), scent (10 ft), Darkvision, Tremorsense (30 ft) Ashen One - Whenever a wildfire dragon uses an ability with the \\[earth] tag, or its timber ability, and a significant pile of ash is on the ground within 5 ft of its AoE, it kicks up a 20 ft radius cloud of ash that persists for 3 rounds. Creatures can see things through 10 ft of ash with partial concealment. Anything past that is total concealment. While within a cloud of ash, creatures without proper protection against harmful gasses are sickened 1 \\[fort negates]. This is a \\[persistent] effect. The wildfire dragon cannot be sickened by this. Stache - A wildfire dragons \"mustache\" hair is quite dexterous, allowing it to perform tasks that require precision, such as sleight of hand.&#x20; Speed - 30, fly 30, burrow 30 (+10 per scale shatter) Overland Flight - When allowed to fly long distances high in the sky, a dragon can fly 600 miles a day, or 1000 if it fatigues itself and never stops to rest. It can continue moving this fast for consecutive days by becoming drained 1 each day it does. Feats - Blind Fight, ligma Skills - +15 (+4) perception, +18 athletics, +18 Sleight of Hand,&#x20;",

They continue to do so every turn they survive. The clones automatically disappear when they take damage or fail a saving throw. Deep Digs \\[mind-affecting] \\[psychic] - This can only target an enemy at the end of their turn.

When she does, the target creature also teleports to another location within 10 feet of their original position and the hag copies their appearance exactly.&#x20; Using this on enemies tends to fall through if they know each other well enough, so hags prefer to choose neutral parties, such as creatures they capture. If they aren't participating in combat because they are a noncombatant, she can use this ability at the end of any other creature's turn to target this noncombatant. Summon Ally \\[recharge] \\[companion] - At the end of another creature's turn, the hag can summon 2 fey of level 2 or lower to appear within 30 feet of her. They share her teamwork feats. Weaknesses/Deep Lore Dealer - Hags typically do not like to engage in combat, and instead prefer to cooperate with other sentient creatures. This is to get something out of them rather than the goodness of their heart. As such, a hag will employ any method in her arsenal: threatening loved ones, offering valuable items or information, healing unique ailments, threatening retaliation etc. Coven - Hags typically exist in trios. They don't live with their sisters, but they tend to have some method to regularly visit them. This could mean they live somewhere close by, they teleport whatever. They keep in regular contact and come to eachother's aid when needed. When gathered, hags possess the ability to perform magical rituals. This allows them to cast spells beyond what they are normally capable of.&#x20; The most notable of which is a type of resurrection usable on the sisters. This happens automatically when the hag dies, and she appears within a special predesignated location in one of the homes of her sisters. The hag is drained 10.

Any other allied creature of at least medium size can throw a gnome in the position as though they were a thrown weapon with +2 attack (as though the gnome was aiding them), dealing 4d6 (14) piercing damage. If a gnome is poise broken while assuming the position, its stance falters and it can no longer be thrown. Weaknesses/Deep Lore Gnome Toss - Gnomes are surprisingly aerodynamic and light. After grappling a gnome, you can choose to end your grapple to toss the gnome (athletics roll) feet in a direction of your choosing. This also happens if you successfully shove, with the athletics roll determining the extra distance moved. This happens instead of the usual effect of grapple and in addition to the effects of a shove. One of a Kind - Gnomes love to steal things that normally come as a set, but only 1 of them, such as a pair of socks or several wheels on a vehicle. When presented with the opportunity to pilfer such an object, a gnome will do everything in their power to steal it. This could mean invading a home after hours, staking out a vehicle etc. Other Traits Ability Scores - Str +2, Dex +2, Lucc +2, Int +0, Wis -1, Cha +2 Gnome Chomsky (Su) \\[poly, true] - Gnomes can transform into a lawn ornament that resembles a gnome. In this form, they can only move while not observed, unless the observers are gnomes. This effectively functions as Hide in Plain Sight.

      "content": "High Roller Level 4 Tiny Fey Defense Traits AC 18\\ HP 52\\ Poise 17\\ Fort +3, Refl +7, Will +5 Blessing of Frogg Saran - High rollers receive a unique blessing from their patron deity. Whenever they take damage type (fire, crush, force), there is a 1 in 6 chance they are resistant to that damage type for that day, including the instance of damage they just took. Once they fail to gain resistance to a damage type, they don't roll it again for the rest of that day. Keep on rolling baby. Offense Traits (DC 16) Rapier (C) +7 (+Lucky Break, Crit vs DD)\\ d6+3 (6) Multiattack - Feint and make a melee attack Innate Techniques - Mage Hand, Ventriloquism\\ 1/day - Fairy Dust, Memory Lapse, WonkaS, Bladed Dash Lucky Break - A high roller gets its name from its ability to pull wins out of its ass from seemingly nowhere. Whenever it rolls a d6 and rolls a 6, it rolls an additional d6. This can happen infinitely. Loaded Dice \\[recharge] - By blowing on a standard dice (a d6) and throwing it up to 30 feet, a high roller can cause it to explode. Deals a number of d6s of force damage equal to the end result of the loaded dice (reflex halves). This explosion is a 10 ft radius, with its center point on the ground where the dice lands. For example, i roll a 4 on the d6. This ability does 4d6 damage. Because of lucky break, this can potentially do infinite damage. If the high roller initially rolls a 6 when determining how many damage dice there are, this ability immediately recharges. Weaknesses/Deep Lore \"Nature Spirit\" \\[poly, true] - A high roller has the ability to transform into a particular butterfly. They are typically exceptionally colorful and sparkly. They can speak while transformed. They use this form to tempt unsuspecting creatures into playing their silly games of chance. 99% of Gamblers - A high roller is always enticed by games of chance, the higher the risk the better. They respect the results of such gambles, even to their own detriment. As such, high rollers are typically in crippling debt. Only 1% of them are filthy rich. Rich high rollers typically have expensive magic items at their disposal. Other Traits Ability Scores - Str -1, Dex +3, Lucc +3, Int +0, Wis -1, Cha +0 Fairy Dust - High rollers have bags of their own natural dust they keep at their hip. It takes a week to gather enough dust to fill a bag. This bag can be used to conjure a single item into existence worth 100 gold or less from the bag. The item is real, but causes the fairy dust to disappear.&#x20; Speed - 30 hover. On their turn they can use this speed to fly Feats - Antagonize, Scapegoat Skills - +5 perception, +9 stealth, +8(+2 feint) deception, +11 profession (gambling)",

A player can choose to spell it out OR have their character roll linguistics (nat 20 always succeeds).\\ \"Easy\" DC 14 - Thoughtful, influential, equipment, syndrome, claimant, intuitively\\ Medium DC 20 - Eusociality, splendiferous, separate, etymology\\ Hard DC 26 - Platitudinous, antennae, silhouette, acquiesce\\ Incorrect responses or cheaters cause the spelling bees swarm to home in on the creature, dealing 10 pierce damage and staggering them for 1 round (fort negates stagger).\\ If multiple spelling bees are present, they give one the floor and don't interrupt with their own questions if one has already been asked this round. Weaknesses/Deep Lore Student Becomes Master - When quizzed, creatures trained in linguistics can make an opposed roll as an immediate action to trip up the spelling bee and have her own swarm sting her. She is immune to the poison however. Mix and Match - Spelling bees love to combine bees with other creatures. By bringing a creature back to their hive, they can transform them to get a new yellow and black coat of paint. For bestiary creatures, this can result in interesting fusions like the Bee Rex.&#x20; If a player offers to be part of the bee's experiments, they can choose to undergo a 1 week transformation. Over this week they transform to more closely resemble a bee with additional limbs, black and yellow fuzzyness and antennae. They also get one of the following boons and banes....\\ Boons - \\ 1 - You can produce honey. You can produce a few ounces of honey each day, as long as you are not going hungry and have a steady supply of flowers. This honey takes about an hour of work and 24 hours of waiting for the moisture to evaporate to be ready for consumption.\\ 2 - You get functional wings, giving you the glide quality.\\ 3 - You get functional antennae, giving you scent 5 ft.\\ 4 - You get a stinger attack with d8 base damage that applies venom on hit. Banes - \\ 1 - You become an herbivore, only able to eat sweet foods like fruit/honey as well as nectar/pollen.\\ 2 - You become a little too fuzzy, making you better adapted for cold climates.

The Master's blessing - Creature experiences the aches and pains of the world much more vividly as their bones grind against each other and each breath too warm, too cold or too wet.

Without some form of outside assistance to protect their mind from dream intruders, they must roll a DC 24 will save or be unable to resist the temptations of this silent dream visitor and partake of her flesh. Interacting with The Master temporarily abates the pain, and the debilitating status of this affliction, for 24 hours.

If the creature separates themselves, they immediately take bleed damage again. The bleed cannot be healed while the creature remains embedded. Embedded creatures are automatically crit by concealed carry. Infernal Chains - A meathook can increase the range of her chains to 30 ft during her turn. When she does so, they become ranged attacks.

Weaknesses/Deep Lore Well-Read (Su) - By poise breaking a tramp with a hard cover book in hand, you can seal it inside of the book until someone reads it or the book is destroyed.

This functions as the demoralize action under the intimidation skill. Special Attack: Frenzied Strike - The chieftain grows noticeably more jittery as their muscles bulge, their mouth froths and their eyes roll into the back of their head. A chieftain makes an amount of simple axe attacks equal to (1+the number of turns they have made a frenzied strike this combat), stacking up to 4 attacks at once.&#x20; Boss Actions - A boss action is usable 1/turn as an instant action with specific triggers. Can only be used at the end of an opposing creature's turn. Sound the Horn \\[healing] - When combat begins, the chieftain blows their war horn. If there are at least 3 other allied orcs in the nearby area, the chieftain is rallied, giving them 40 temp hp.\\ Finish Him - Command an ally within 60 ft to make an attack against a defeated creature.\\ Chieftain's Command \\[recharge] \\[healing] - Snap an ally within 30 ft out from an effect that causes the frightened or fascinated conditions.\\ Feast \\[recharge] \\[healing] - The chieftain drives their fist into a dead enemy's chest, then pulls out and consume their heart. All allies that can see them, and the chieftain themselves, gains 10 temp hp. This kills the enemy.\\ Dishonorable COWARDS - Can only be used in response to a creature breaking the rules of Mak'Gora. Immediately use the Warcry technique, and its radius increases to 40 ft. Weaknesses/Deep Lore Mak'Gora - Chieftain of an orc tribe is an ever shifting position, and a chief must be ready to defend their position. If you challenge the chieftain to a duel, they may be willing to partake depending on the circumstances. Even if they don't the pressure of their peers may goad them into it (will negates, DC). If they pass their save they make up an excuse to placate their band of warriors. The murderous chieftain and the members of their tribe fight with honor to the death, and will not aid each other using magic, items etc, before or during the fight. It is expected the opponent does the same. Breaking the rules in the middle of the battle, such as to cast a spell on an ally, causes the duel to break down and a chaotic battle ensues. In such cases, the war chief gets access to the a new boss action.&#x20; A war band will respect the results of the battle, and bow to whoever is the victor.

      "content": "🌊 Water Water has a lot to talk about, so I'll break it up into 4 sections: Aquatic combat, underwater combat, water pressure and drowning. Aquatic Combat - This refers to combat that happens in and around water, but typically not completely submerged. As far as visibility is concerned, most of the time you can see to the bottom of lakes and rivers unless they are particularly murky. Oceans, seas and particularly wide lakes or rivers are the exception to this, where they can be deep enough that even in ideal conditions you can't see all the way down. When a creature not in water attacks another creature that is at least waist deep in water, they have cover. Creatures not in water cannot attack creatures that are completely submerged if they are more than 5 feet deep. Underwater Combat - Fighting underwater can make many fighting styles completely useless. Projectile weapons like guns can't fire at all. Thrown weapons don't function at all either. Bows and such have their range reduced to 10/20 ft. Melee combatants take a -4 penalty to attack unless they use a piercing weapon. Many of these things have workarounds. Certain types of weapons can be specifically designed for underwater use. Aquatic creatures, amphibious creatures and creatures trained in athletics figure out methods to ignore the melee attacking penalty. Water Pressure - Roughly every 30 ft you descend into water, you double the amount of pressure your body experiences. Going past 150 ft is usually impossible without being an aquatic creature, special equipment or magic. If you do not have such aid, then going deeper than 60 ft is usually a bad idea. In combat you don't have the luxury of slowly ascending to avoid the bends. If you ascend more than 5 feet a round after diving to this depth, you must make fortitude save or become drained 1 and dazed. The DC is 20+every additional 5 feet you moved (10 feet DC 21, 20 ft DC 23 etc.). Even if you pass your save, you are still drained 1. Drowning - Most creatures can pretty handily hold their breath for 30 seconds while under duress (or 5 rounds). For every point of strength you can hold it for an additional round. Every round past this limit inflicts drain. The first round you drain 1, the second drain 2 etc, causing you to rapidly die if you are unable to somehow breathe. With specific equipment, magic or training, or being aquatic/amphibious, you can increase or eliminate this limit entirely. The most common way is gillweed.",

Bonuses RecoveryAt the start of a boss's turn, if it is still suffering from an effect from status that affected it last turn, it gets a new save against the effect.The intention is to stop stun-lock from a single effect.Boss ActionsThe boss can act out of turn in response to specific events, usually at the end of a player's (or their allies') turns. These actions should typically be low impact compared to its main turn, doing things like creating disruptive terrain, summoning minions etc.The intention is to make the boss feel a little bit more dynamic, like it's responding to the player's actions and acting accordingly.

      "content": "Defense Traits Amorphous In order to crit the creature, you must exceed its AC by a value higher than 10. Example Amorphous - +15 Damage Reduction (DR) Damage reduction (shortened DR) is a unique defensive property that comes in two different forms. Whenever a creature takes damage that their DR applies to, reduce the damage by the corresponding amount.\\ Denoted as follows. The x represents a numerical value. DR x\\ Only applies to physical damage (Crush, slash, Pierce) and poise damage. Some instances of DR only apply to poise damage from specific combat maneuvers DRA x\\ Applies to all damage types (minus true damage) All forms of damage reduction stack with each other. Damage reduction applies in the most advantageous way possible for the creature (after halving from saves or resistances for example). If an attack's damage is reduced to zero, any additional effects the attack would apply do not occur. Fast Healing The creature gains specified amount of hp the start of their turn if they are not defeated. When the creature is defeated, this ability is disabled for 10 minutes (see medicine for other means to keep those pesky healers down). If a creature with FH is bleeding, roll a luck check (DC 10) to see if the bleeding stops at the end of their turns. Ferocity When the creature is reduced to zero hit points, they are not defeated until the end of their next turn. On said turn they are staggered. If a creature with ferocity is healed before their next turn, the creature is not defeated at the end of its next turn, and this ability is not consumed, however they are still staggered. This ability can only activate once per minute. FH does not function while in ferocity. Incorporeal Incorporeal creatures have resistance to crush, slash and pierce damage. They cannot be combat maneuvered without special equipment or techniques. Incorporeal creatures universally have hover speeds. Incorporeal creatures can pass through physical objects, but cannot end their turn inside of one. This allows them to ignore cover bonuses and more easily hide. Immunity Rare defensive quality. This creature is immune to a specific type of status effect and/or damage type. A common one is mindless creatures (creatures that lack an intelligence score, denoted by a - in the ability scores section) are immune to mind-affecting effects like fear and charm. Resistance When a creature has resistance to a type of status effect or damage type, the creature takes only half damage from effects that deal that damage type. When a creature has a resistance to a tag, it lists the numerical value that it gets a bonus to saves against abilities with that tag (such as \\[fear] \\[charm] etc). {% hint style=\"success\" %} Creatures with resistance to poison also have a +4 bonus to the envenomed condition {% endhint %} Regeneration The creature regains a specified amount of hp at the start of their turn. This healing is capable of restoring lost limbs over a few days, or instantly if the limb is reattached. At the start of this creature's turn it loses the defeated condition, restores HP, and the creature is staggered instead of dazed. All forms of regeneration have some means to stop it (typically for 1 round), usually taking a specific type of damage.&#x20; If a creature is defeated while its regeneration is disabled, it is unable to regenerate for 10 minutes (see medicine for other means to keep those pesky healers down).",

      "content": "Fundamentals Natural Attacks Natural attacks always have the light property. It's very common for monsters to have sharp claws and teeth, but having more claws and more teeth doesn't necessarily lead to them having more attacks. In a typical bestiary stat block, a monster will have sets of attack actions each with their own specified stats. If a creatures stats mentions the multi-attack property, then when they take a standard action to attack, they are allowed to make multiple attacks of the specified types. Some creatures have conditional multiattacks. Example Sting (P) +3\\ 2d6+2 (9) Multiattack - Can only be made against creatures with a speed of 0 (entangle, stun etc). \\ Make 2 sting attacks. Innate Casting Some techniques can be granted outside of the standard progression, such as things gained from race, class, magic items, specialized training, or some kind of boon granted by another creature. Usually quite limited in scope and much more common on monsters. Innate techniques do not take up memory slots and are always memorized. Innate techniques grant creatures the ability to use a specific set of techniques. Spells do not require the staff/seal component that other casting typically requires. If a spell has a material or focus component, that is also ignored with innate casting. By default, creatures with innate techniques can use their techniques an unlimited number of times. Number values are included next to techniques that have limited uses per day. Mana burn still applies to innately casted spells. If a spell is constant, the spell is persistently active on the creature and takes up its \\[buff] slot. A new buff can be cast on it, rendering the constant spell inactive. If it's constant spell is deactivated, it can reactivate it as a swift action.",

Some are passive some require activation.&#x20; All auras are \\[persistent] effects, meaning creature can only be affected by a negative aura once per round. Breath Weapon (Su) The creature has the ability to use a supernatural area of effect attack. Common forms include lines and cones of elemental damage. Most breath weapons are \\[recharge] effects that have some condition to use them again. Deathrattle An effect happens when the creature dies, requiring no action. This typically involves exploding or releasing toxic gases. Gaze (Su) Merely by looking at another creature nearby, they can inflict some kind of effect. The creature can use a standard action in order to gaze at a specific creature within 30 ft. Some creatures have gaze attacks that automatically happen to all creatures within a specific range. Anybody combating a creature with a gaze attack has a few options to try and negate it, made when they first are affected by the gaze attack. * They can choose to close their eyes (instant action), giving themselves the blinded condition until the start of their next turn, making them immune gaze attacks. * Alternatively they can choose to avert their gaze, giving them blurred vision and advantage on saves against gaze attacks. Gaze attacks can be avoided entirely by looking at the creature through a proxy, like a reflective surface. Grappling Abilities Attach - When the creature grapples another creature it instead gains the grappled condition, typically due to its smaller size. Creatures with the attached property typically have special abilities that can only be used while attached. Constrict - When a creature with the constrict property succeeds on a grapple check they automatically deal damage from a specified attack form. Every turn they maintain the grapple they also do this effect. Engulf - When the creature succeeds on a grapple check they can engulf the target. The target gains the entombed condition. Usually the creature can take no action other than to use athletics to escape. Allies can use athletics to pull you out or poise break the creature to set you free. Swallow - After successfully grappling a creature, the creature can choose to swallow its prey if it is at least one size category larger. The prey maintains the grapple penalties and the swallowing creature doesn't need to take any actions to maintain the grapple. The prey gains total cover and takes a specified amount of damage the turn it is swallowed immediately and at the end of the swallowed creatures turn thereafter. A creature cannot use its swallow quality while sickened 2 or higher. Becoming sickened 2 causes it to vomit any swallowed creatures. The prey escapes automatically when the swallowing creature is defeated. Powerful Charge The creature gets a +2 bonus to attack during any round they make a charge. Rend Whenever the creature lands the listed attacks (including poise breaking the creature), they inflict an additional effect, usually damage. Example Rend - Two claws (2d6) Summon Ally (Su) [companion] Functions like a summoning contract, but does not require a contract, usually only summoning lesser creatures. Only requires a standard action and can potentially summon multiple creature at once. Can also grant other bonuses to summoned creatures, in addition to the companion boost to attack. Trample Creature can move around through other creatures spaces to knock them over. As a FRA a creature can move its speed, or double its speed in a straight line, and harm all creatures along its path, dealing damage and knocking them down. Creatures can choose to either AoO or make a reflex save for a reduced effect. Venomous Inflicts the Envenomed status effect with one of its attacks or abilities, which functions as follows. Venom comes in 3 stages. In order to advance from one to the next, the afflicted creature must fail a fortitude save. The venom continues until they creature passes a fortitude save. Some creatures may have different effects for their venom, but this is the assumed default if no other details are listed. Stage 1 - Creature is sickened 1, which cannot be removed until the creature is no longer poisoned.\\ 1 minute after the creature fails its first save, it must roll again or hit stage 2.&#x20; Stage 2 - Creature is sickened 2, which cannot be removed until the creature is no longer poisoned. The creature also has disadvantage on skill checks.\\ 10 minutes after the creature fails its second save, it must roll again. Stage 3 - Creature is sickened 3, which cannot be removed until the creature is no longer poisoned. The creature gains the defeated condition. In stage 3, a creature must roll a save every 10 minutes. Each failure adds a stack of drain.",

      "content": "Other Traits Amphibious Amphibious creatures can exist comfortably on land or underwater, including the ability to breathe underwater or the ability to hold their breath for long periods of time. Blindsense This creature has extraordinary senses that allows it to sense the presence of creatures without sight. A creature with blind sense has +4 bonus on perception against a creature to which its blindsense applies. The creature automatically receives a perception check with no penalty when a creature enters this range, even while naturally asleep, and automatically wakes up if it senses something. A successful perception check indicates the creature has \"locked on\" and identified the space the creature is in. They gain seeking against any creature \"locked on.\" Once a creature with blind sense has \"locked on\" to a creature, it stays detected until it leaves the creature's blindsense range, or the creatures blind sense is disabled. A creature with blind sense can use the \"detect hidden presence\" feature of perception as a free action once per turn, but only the affecting the range of its blind sense. Blind sense relies on a specific sense (mentioned in the ability), usually hearing or scent, but can also include things like detecting life (with undead creatures), or feeling tremors in the ground/water. Blind sense can circumstantially be negated, based on the source. Echolocation - Sound based. A creature that takes sonic damage has their echolocation disabled for one round. Lifesense (Su) - Functions against living creatures. Undead, constructs (and other similar not really alive) creatures cannot be detected with life sense. Scent - Uses a creature sense of smell. Aquatic creatures can only use this underwater. Amphibious creatures can use it in water or land. If you have an item with a creatures scent on it, you get a +2 bonus on survival checks to track them. Scents can be remembered similarly to how you can recognize someone's voice. Creatures with scent automatically get a perception check (vs disguise) against someone impersonating a creature they are very close to. A creature that is sickened cannot use scent. Tremorsense - Vibration based. Aquatic creatures can use this underwater. Amphibious creatures can use it in water or land. Only functions if the creature (and any creatures it is attempting to detect) is in direct contact with a physical surface. A creature that is clumsy cannot use tremorsense. Thought Sense (Su) - Functions against intelligent creatures. Mindless creatures cannot be detected with thought sense. A creature that is shaken cannot use thought sense. Sightless Blind Sense - In the absence of sight, blindsense is enhanced. The usual methods for preventing blindsense (sickened with super scent) from functioning impose partial concealment on all creatures that their blindsense cannot negate until the condition is removed. Creatures with sightless blindsense instead get a +8 bonus to perception when blindsense applies and its range is usually higher. Compression You are able to move through spaces designed for creatures 1 size smaller than you without treating it as difficult terrain. You are able to move through spaces designed for creatures 2 sizes smaller than you by treating it as difficult terrain Camouflage Creature can use stealth to hide without cover or concealment. Cannot be used while being directly observed. May come with other conditions for use. Hide in Plain Sight Creature has the ability to successfully hide from creatures while standing perfectly still by pretending to be an inanimate object or changing colors. If the creature is already being observed, or enemies have already been surprised by the creature using this ability recently, then it does not function. Typically creatures do not get a check to see a creature that is hiding in plain sight until they go out of their way to inspect the nearby area, or the hiding creature acts. The DC to detect them is based on their offense trait DC rather than stealth, but functions similarly when used to surprise attack. If creature has stealth, they can choose to roll it as normal to ambush. Movement Types Burrow - A creature with a burrow speed can tunnel through dirt, but not through rock, unless the descriptive text says otherwise. Creatures leaves a temporary trail behind, unless measures are taken to maintain the hole. You cannot charge while burrowing. Starting to burrow underground requires a swift action and provokes an AoO as though moving out of a threatened space. Climb - A creature with a climb speed can easily ascend or descend trees, walls buildings etc, provided there are ample places to place hands, feet etc. Creatures with climb speeds can even climb things without ample handholds using creative methods or exceptional biology in some cases (gecko, snake wrapping around). Flight - You can use a fly speed to move directly up into the air. Any movement moving up at greater than a 45 degree angle is considered difficult terrain. Taking flight requires a swift action that provokes attacks of opportunity as though moving out of a threatened space. Whenever you take damage while flying, gain clumsy 1. You cannot ascend while clumsy. Creatures with flight automatically also have glide. While a creatures speed is reduced to zero, it cannot fly, and plummets. Glide - While not movement impaired, take no fall damage. Reduce any fall damage to minimum value. When falling, move horizontally 5 feet per 1 foot fallen at a speed of 60. Hover - A lesser form of flight, or perhaps something supernatural like telekinesis. Functions as a land speed, but you float around a foot above the ground, allows you to ignore small changes in terrain.&#x20; Some creatures can use hover to fly during their turn, but they must end their movement hovering over flat-ish ground. You cannot use hover to temporarily fly while clumsy. While clumsy, your hover speed is reduced by 15. Swim - Creatures with a swim speed take no penalties to fighting underwater. Most creatures with a swim speed are either aquatic or amphibious. Polymorph (Su) \\[Poly] Allows a creature to turn into a different creature. The description of the ability will include the features that it gains when it does so (based off of the features of the shapeshifter class). If there are no listed features then assumes that it gains none. While polymorphed a creature is unable to use any of the abilities based on its physical form, such as its natural attacks or poison, if they originate from their original form. Descriptions typically use features from the shapeshifter class. Ex Polymorph: Humanoid (Su) \\[poly, true] - Any medium or small humanoid Polymorph: Beast, Dog (Su) \\[poly, true] - Attack (bite), Manhandle (topple) Special Senses Darkvision - You can see well in complete darkness. Treat any form of darkness as bright light. Everything in darkness is grayscale. Green Sight (Su) - Can see through any form of vegetation. Creatures cannot use vegetation as a source of cover to hide against this creature. Nightvision - A lesser form of darkvision. You treat dim light as bright light. You treat darkness as dim light. These effects do not combine to allow you to treat darkness as bright light. Everything in darkness is grayscale. Telepathy (Su) The creature can speak directly into the minds of other creatures it can see. A creature must have an intelligence score of at least -2 in order to be telepathically communicated with. A creature can telepathically project its thoughts to several creatures in the nearby vicinity, even if it cannot see them.&#x20; Once a creature initiates a telepathic conversation, the other creature can communicate back using telepathy. The creature that initiated the telepathic conversation can choose to end it whenever they wish.",

      "content": "Major Making your own class features can be tough, both maintaining balance and a cohesive theme. This section should help provide guidelines for not only the types of things you should be thinking about studying for your alchemist, but also the power of the mechanical effects. In general, majors can be separated into a few categories. EnhancerPrimarily focused on adding attributes to creatures. Your creations are the next step in evolution or create entirely new types/fusions creatures.Examples: Shao Tucker (FMA)TransformerPrimarily focused on enhancing the self. These transformations come with great power, but also some kind of crippling flaw.Examples: Dr. Jekyll n Mr. Hyde, The Hulk, Armor-Bonded Souls (FMA)ManipulatorPrimarily focused on manipulating physical matter in the world. You turn objects into other things or focus on a specific type of chemical reaction, like starting fires or causing explosions.Examples: Most alchemists in FMA,Friend CrafterYou made 1 specific very special creature. It’s a homunculus, or sentient ooze or something more exotic.Examples: Flubber, Chaos (Sonic Adventure), Driders (DnD) 1 - Major The main thing that you should be focusing on for your major is thinking about a completely unique thing that your character specializes in. It should be specific and limited in scope. Idea Phase:\\ \"I specialize in transforming into animals\" is a bit too vague and is too similar to the shapeshifter class. If we are on the cutting edge of new techniques, we want something that isn't just another class's features. \"I specialize in grafting beast parts to people\" is more specific, and falls more closely in line with what you imagine a fantasy scientist would do. For me at least, it's easy to imagine Frankenstein's monster type alchemist that has slowly replaced his body with more optimal animal parts to become a completely unique creature. Mechanics Phase:\\ Sticking with the idea of grafting animal parts, this idea lends itself well to an enhancer type play style. You might gather the parts during your adventures by purchasing them or killing the beasts yourself, but gaining benefits requires work you do ahead of time. Crafting rules are elsewhere, where you can find how long it takes, how much it cost and how difficult it should be. Right now we are concerned with the mechanics. What should a grafted part do? Considering you are fusing parts onto yourself you could give yourself noteworthy parts from other animals to gain permanent abilities: Dog nose for scent, bull horns for a natural attack, fins and gills for aquatic adventures. Considering you're replacing your humanoid parts, there might also be some drawbacks. Lion claws aren't the best for grasping things like opposable thumbs are, for example. An ability like this can open up opportunities for limitless power as long as you keep pouring resources into it, so it should also have some hard limitation. Limiting yourself to only mixing and matching 3 parts for example. Considering the mechanical effect is similar, perhaps use shapeshifter's point system as a basis for how powerful the individual parts can be. 6 - Thesis Thesis marks the point where few have developed their research to this point. This should be the point where you start bending rules and creating increasingly ridiculous items with your craft. Continuing with the idea of grafting animal parts, this is where you might add a second tier to your crafting. No longer are you just replacing parts, but you can add completely new ones, doing things like turning people into centaurs of all kinds of creatures, giving yourself an additional limb, maybe an extra beast head. Up the limit of how many parts you can give a creature, so long as they are willing to accept tier 2 augmentations. 11 - Grand Discovery Grand discovery marks the point where only the best, brightest and most insane push their research to the boundaries of what should be possible. This is the point where you should be breaking rules and doing things once only thought imaginary. By combining different animal parts from dead creatures, you can create entirely new creatures. You can make alterations to yourself to make you completely unrecognizable from when you began. Once upon a time you were a man. Now you are a massive spider from the waist down allowing you to climb any surface with ease, your torso is covered in thick chitin to protect your vitals, your head is covered in beady eyes to allow you to see in all directions.",

A dangerous cult could be lurking in a city and you warn the people to avoid people with a specific symbol on them. When you replace songs using your companion slots, they might not be the talk of the town anymore, being regularly performed on the streets, but they might not be forgotten. If you do a large scale organized event in the area where your song is a hit, you can make one last perform check to see if it sticks for good. See below for DCs. The distance this song spreads is dependent on your level.

After the minute passes or after using a finale, you cannot activate bardic performance again for 1 minute. Performances affect all creatures within 30 ft of you, specifying either allies or enemies. You can change the type of performance that you're doing as a swift action. A creature that steps within the radius of a performance, gains its benefit/penalties for one round, even if it only exists in it briefly. As a standard action, you can immediately end your performance to perform some kind of powerful action called a finale. Any allies that are within the area of your bardic performance before you perform your finale still gain its benefit for that round. The types of performances and finales a bard has is based on archetype. 2 - Countercharm \\[charm] When you succeed on a save against a charm effect, the creature who inflicted it is charmed by you for the effects usual duration. 2 - Inspiration \\[mana burn] By burning 1 mana as an immediate action, you can allow a creature within 30 ft to add d4 to a d20 roll (minus luck checks).\\ @6 increase to d6\\ @11 increase to d8 6 - High Note As a swift action, increase the effectiveness of bardic performance for 1 round.\\ If it targets allies, double the numerical bonuses of a bardic performance.\\ If it targets enemies, increase the DC by 2.

Initiating and maintaining concentration on air bending requires a standard action each turn. 3 - Elemental Intuition: Gliding Technology You've learned how to utilize gliding technology to allow you to fly. A glider requires 50g of wood and canvas and 8 hours to make. You gain a fly speed equal to your speed while using this glider. If the glider is sundered, you cannot use it to fly. Using a glider requires one hand. 5 - Elemental Intuition: Airbending Adept Jumping using airbending no longer requires concentration. By spending a standard action to concentrate each turn, you can fly by creating a whirlwind underneath you, even without a glider. You are limited to flying 30 ft high like this. Each round you concentrate to fly like this you also remove all clumsy stacks. You do not provoke AoOs by taking flight.

Sighted creatures within 30 feet of you become fascinated for up to 1 minute (will negates). 6 - Zap Arc&#x20; You can cause your zap blast to jump to an additional target within 30 feet of the original, requiring a separate attack roll. If you charge the blast, you can target a third creature. 6 - Firewall (3) \\[concentration] \\[persistent] Create a barrier made out of fire. Creatures cannot see through the wall. You can make this barrier in different shapes. At least one section of the wall must be within reach. Castle: 5 ft radius wall 10 ft high.\\ Wall: 10 ft tall, 30 ft wide\\ If you charge, you can increase the castle radius by 5 ft and its height by 10 ft. You can increase the wall's length by 30 ft and its height by 10 ft.&#x20; Every time a creature moves through the barrier, they take your blast damage (reflex halves). Creatures 5 ft from the barrier take your level in damage each turn. You take no damage from existing near your wall or passing through it. 6 - Zap Arc (3)&#x20; You can cause your zap blast to jump to an additional target within 30 feet of the original, requiring a separate attack roll. If you charge, you can target a third creature. 8 - Burning Up&#x20; Your fire elemental blast and elemental wave features set targets hit/fail their save ablaze. 10 - Redirection (5) When you or an ally within reach are targeted by an effect you can use your elemental counter feature against, you can use it as an immediate action. If you are successful, you can redirect it as though you had cast it, using your class DC. If you fail, you become the target (or center of the effect). 10 - Meteor (5) \\[persistent] \\[recharge]&#x20; Launch an immense fire blast into the sky, the center of which lands on a space within 120 ft of you. Creatures within 5 ft of the impact zone have disadvantage on their save. Deal blast damage in a 40 ft radius and set all creatures ablaze (reflex halves damage and negates ablaze). The meteor's AoE sets creatures that walk through it ablaze (reflex negates). 10 - Roiling Magma (5) \\[recharge] \\[concentration] \\[persistent] You smash the ground violently, and magma pours from the impact, rapidly filling a 20 ft radius around you with magma rapidly. Creatures in the initial area of the spell take blast damage and have lava cling to them (reflex halves dmg and negates lava cling). Creatures that have lava cling to them have -15 speed and take 3d6 (10) fire damage each round at the end of their turns until 1 minute passes, or they are cooled through other means, such as getting wet or taking cold damage. The AoE left behind is difficult terrain, and creatures that move through it have lava cling to them (reflex negates). You ignore all the negative effects of your roiling magma.",

You can use this swim speed to surf across water's surface. You take no fall damage when falling into water if you can move. 1 - Elemental Defense: Water Shield You can take any of the shield actions. You can use all of the shield special attacks. You can use the buckler's parry feature. You only need water to perform these maneuvers. 1 - Elemental Intuition: Waterbending \\[concentration] You can physically manipulate water (including ice) within 30 ft. Bending as a whole allows for a great deal of creativity, but shouldn’t affect objects of a size greater than one 5ft cube per level. Redirecting water flow and creating temporary air bubbles to hide in water sources are some examples of things that you can do. Concentration with this ability requires a standard action each round. When you cease concentration, flow you redirect stops and water you are lifting falls. You can also use all waterbending based abilities using water adjacent substances, such as fruit juice, blood or perfume. This does not include liquids of other substances, such as acids, poisons, mercury, lava etc. 3 - Elemental Intuition: Freeze You can use your elemental blast to deal cold damage or crush damage interchangeably. You can use water walking on ice. In general, you can use water, even moisture in the air, to decrease the temperature of things, such as to freeze metal to make it more brittle. 5 - Elemental Intuition: Waterbending Adept You no longer need to concentrate in order to maintain structures created by water bending. You can carry large quantities of water with you using waterbending in order to fuel your abilities. Doing so for longer than 10 minutes without resting for 1 minute fatigues you. 7 - Elemental Intuition: Water Limbs Your natural reach increases during your turn by 5 ft this level and every level thereafter (max 30).

You can use elemental blast to perform combat maneuvers from a range. All combat maneuvers you do with your blast get a +4 bonus. 1 - Riposte You can also parry attacks aimed at allies within your blast range.\\ When you successfully parry an attack, you can make an attack against the creature as an instant action, including using your blast. You can riposte against any attackers within 30 ft of you. 1 - Soothing Waves (1) \\[healing] \\[recharge] Using clean water, touch a creature to heal (blast damage) hp. This ability has a 1 minute cooldown.\\ You can choose to give this the \\[overheal] tag, but it also gains \\[mana burn]. Clean water counts as a medicine kit for you. 1 - Mist (1) \\[concentration] You permanently memorize the Fog Cloud technique. By spending a standard action each turn, you can cause it to follow your movement, or the movement of another creature of your choosing within 30 ft. You can also spend a standard action to increase its size, essentially adding another fog cloud adjacent to the first one. 1 - Drench (1) As a swift action, give a creature the wet condition. If it is an enemy (reflex negates). This can effectively wash a creature clean for any features where that is relevant.&#x20; 1 - Plant Bending You can move loose vegetation with your bending such as vines or other long flexible plants. This does not function against particularly dry plants like tumbleweed or dead plants. Against plant creatures, your blasts have a +2 bonus to attack or the DC as appropriate. 1 - Bubble (1)&#x20; As a standard action, you can bend water around the head of a creature within reach. A protective bubble forms around it, allowing it to breathe freely underwater for 1 hour. 1 - Water-Ish Bending (1)&#x20; You can use water bending to manipulate any liquids in the alchemical items section as though using the catapult technique, but it deals your blast damage instead of its standard damage. When you use the administer potion action, you can use waterbending to administer it as a swift action. This also makes it so it does not consume the targets immediate action. 4 - Ice Slick (2) \\[concentration] \\[Persistent] Completely freeze over a surface in slick ice. Freeze a 10 ft radius, centered on a point. Creatures inside of this radius are knocked down (reflex negates). Moving through an iced space knocks down creatures (reflex negates). You can avoid falling by treating icy spaces as difficult terrain. 4 - Icy Hold (2) Creature within 30 ft takes blast damage and is made frosty or entangled (reflex halves dmg and negates status). \\ Athletics to escape entangle as a swift action. 1 fire damage frees the creature automatically. 4 - Imbalanced Whenever you use your elemental wave feature, creatures are made clumsy 1 on a failed save.\\ When you land your elemental blast, creatures are clumsy 1. 4 - Push OR Pull&#x20; Remove the mana cost of elemental wave.\\ Creatures that fail their save against your elemental wave are pushed away from you or pulled towards you 10 ft (your choosing for all affected creatures). 6 - Water Pressure Your water attacks are considered to be of adamantine toughness for the purposes of destroying objects. 6 - Ice Wall (3) \\[concentration] Create a barrier made out of ice with enough water. Creatures cannot see through the wall. You can make this barrier in different shapes. At least one section of the wall must be within reach.&#x20; Igloo: 10 ft radius dome, complete with door.\\ Castle: 5 ft radius wall 10 ft high.\\ Wall: 10 ft tall, 30 ft wide.&#x20; Creature can use athletics as a standard action to break through a 5x5 section of a wall (or more for larger creatures). Alternatively an attack that does 10 crush damage or 5 fire damage destroys a 5x5 section of the wall. 6 - Favored Terrain (3)&#x20; As a swift action, you can use waterbending to create icy terrain that lasts until the end of your turn, or until the end of your next turn. This can be used to make things like bridges, ramps, stairs or a small barrier to avoid an AoO. 6 - Water Prison&#x20; You permanently memorize aqueous orb without spending memory. If it originates from a body of water, your CL is increased by 2 and the orbs speed increases to 40 ft. 8 - Cryofreeze (4) You can freeze a defeated creature, giving them stasis permanently. Must take at least 30 fire damage to unfreeze. You can unfreeze them as an instant action if they are within 30 ft. 8 - Whirlpool (4) \\[concentration] \\[persistent] Choose a point on the surface of the water within 60 feet of you. Water within 30 ft rapidly starts to twist and turn toward that point, carrying anything within. Creatures within the area are immediately caught in the whirlpool (fort negates, putting them out of the AoE at nearest point). When the creature is caught, and every round thereafter, they take your blast damage (crush) and are pulled closer to the center in a very random fashion (roll dice to determine which side they end up on). After the second round of being caught, they are completely submerged underwater. Each round a creature can attempt an athletics check as a FRA to escape the whirlpool's area.\\ You are immune to the effects of your own whirlpool.\\ All creatures in the area are made wet. Special: If you use this outside of a body of water, its DC decreases by 2 and its radius decreases to 15 ft. 8 - Icy Prison (4) \\[recharge] Entomb a creature in ice (reflex reduces effect to frosty). An attack that does 10 crush damage or 5 fire damage destroys the ice and frees the creature. An entombed creature can roll an athletics check as a standard action to escape. 10 - Waters of Life (5) \\[recharge] \\[healing] By spending 1000g to perform a special ritual, requiring 10 minutes of concentration, you can bless a small vial of water with incredible healing capabilities. You can use this blessed water to bring a creature back from the dead at 1 hp if it died within the last minute. You can innately tell when a creature is too far gone to heal with this.\\ You can only have one vial of this blessed liquid at a time. 10 - Octopus Stance (5) \\[buff] \\[recharge]&#x20; As a standard action, enter octopus stance for 10 minutes, causing 8 tendrils of water to form around you. As an instant action, you can take a shield action or parry by sacrificing a tentacle. 10 - Tsunami (5) \\[recharge] \\[concentration] \\[persistent] Cause an enormous and powerful wave of water to wash over the world. Form a wave 60 ft wide and 30 ft high that originates from your space and launch it in a direction. It moves 60 feet each round on your turn for 3 rounds before crashing. When the wave passes over a creature, it gets picked up by the wave (fort negates). When it gets picked up and every round after it takes blast damage and is entombed in the wave. A creature can attempt athletics with a -4 penalty as a FRA to escape, getting deposited somewhere near where they were trapped. If a creature is within the wave when it crashes, it takes 50% increased damage and is stunned for 1 round. You can choose to ride the wave if you wish. The wave deals massive damage to structures and carries objects unless they are securely rooted in the ground. All creatures in the area are made wet. Special: If the waves starting point is outside of a body of water, its DC decreases by 2, its height decreases to 15 and its width decreases to 30. 10 - Blood Bending (5) \\[concentration] \\[recharge]&#x20; Take control of the body of creature within 30 ft of you (assuming a significant portion of its body composition is made of water like humanoids), stunning it for 3 rounds (fort reduces to stagger for 3 rounds). As part of initially using the ability, and each round it is staggered/stunned by this ability as a swift action, you can cause the creature to attack its friends. If the creature is stunned, you can move it up to its speed and make simple attacks or take the charge action. If it is staggered, you can only force it to make a simple attack.",

They automatically know all techniques (still capped by the technique level maximum) that match the tag of elemental blasts they can use. In addition, I added a list of other techniques I thought thematically appropriate. You can replace the damage of any attacks in techniques with your blast damage (not compatible with upcast damage). You can use your blast to deliver the effects of techniques and special attacks, though they still must match the type of attack (ranged attack, melee attack etc).

Once chosen it cannot be changed. Your elements decides many aspects of your class. In order to use any (Su) class abilities, you must meet requirements based on the element. You get a +4 bonus on saves against effects that share the same tag as your element. 1 - Elemental Blast (Su) As a standard action you attack a foe within 30 ft using either str or dex as your attacking stat. If the creature is out of reach, it counts as a ranged attack. If the creature is within your natural reach, you can either make the blast as a melee or ranged attack. It's damage is 2d6+str/dex, increasing by d6 @3 and every odd level after. The damage type is determined by your favored element. 1 - Elemental Movement (Su) Gain a bonus movement type based off of your favored element. 1 - Elemental Defense (Su) Gain a defensive property based off of your favored element. 1 - Elemental Intuition (Su) These features are passives gained regularly by leveling up. These features are universal for each element. Gain one each odd level. 1 - Elemental Styles (Su) These features give your bending more options.

For example, King Bumi earthbending when inside of what is essentially a coffin when only his head is exposed. Allowing that kind of power while completely restrained can create problems. In general, I'd say that anything that can prevent you from making unarmed attacks can also prevent you from using elemental blast/wave/techniques. Some exceptions can be made (like firebending's melt feature), but in general, standard methods of restraint should be sufficient to prevent most abilities from functioning. Elemental Jank In the show, elemental attacks can originate from places other than directly where the attacker is standing.

This can include things like a cat or dog walking on 2 legs for a short period, a rat making an unusually large amount of noise squeaking or a fish jumping out of water to do a barrel roll.&#x20; This beast can also serve as an emissary to its kind in the surrounding area. If you are willing to wait 10 minutes (and the beast in question has a substantial local population), this singular beast can multiply into dozens, or potentially hundreds to perform incredibly unusual activities. A bunch of local cats marching in the streets to your marching orders, a band of differently sized rats squeaking a simple jingle you orchestrate or an entire school of fish moving to make shapes of your choosing as you speak (ex finding nemo). You can only call a group of beasts in this way 1/week. 1 - Phone a Friend You can always find a general category of beast (something smart, a swimmer, something rideable, beast of burden, a reptile etc) by spending 5 minutes to look around your environment, provided there is one that exists.

Generally speaking, weaker creatures and herbivores are the first to respond. 1 - Petting Technique You get advantage on wild empathy checks when used against beasts/magical beasts. 2 - Copycat \\[poly, true] As a swift action, you can copy any animal you can see within 30 ft. This transformation gives no boons, merely changes your size/appearance. You can speak normally while in animal form. This transformation lasts indefinitely, but can be ended as a swift action. While transformed you have advantage on disguise checks to go unnoticed if the animal could reasonably be there (dogs in urban areas, birds perched on trees, but not horses in an inn or a dinosaur in the arctic). 2 - Nature Strikes \\[recharge] You can call beasts and magical beasts to your side to aid you in battle. The type of help they provide is something they must be able to do naturally. The entire effect must happen within 60 ft of you and the AoE is a 20 ft radius or a 60 ft line.

It grows more powerful as you do. More rules on beast companions in the beast companion section of beast trainer. Its level is 1/3 your level. 4 - Get Shit On \\[Recharge] 1/day you can force a serendipity check, so long as the result includes animals as a major component. You must decide what you want to happen first, then your DM tells you its DC. Negotiate a simpler task if you think the DC is too high. Some examples of what you can accomplish… 5Get a group of animals to agree with you by making some kind of vocalization10Get a bird to poop on someone while outdoors20A vendor that sells pets renders in town If you fail the check then nothing happens, potentially making you look like an idiot depending on the setup. 6 - Lolcat Gain a new option with Nature Strikes You summon a cat/kitten to a spot you can see within 100 ft. The cat immediately starts doing something silly or adorable, like eating a cheeseburger or existing with a silly outfit. Creatures within 30ft of this cat are fascinated for 1 minute (will negates). Creatures that are minions to you get no save. Creature doesn't need to be a cat. Can easily be some other silly animal. Cats just have a high concentration of silly. 11 - King of Beasts You get an honorary crown, befitting of a king of beasts. All beasts treat you with the reverence usually only afforded to royalty by their subjects and servants. Unless a beast is under direct control from another creature, or a higher level than you, it will not harm you or otherwise impair you. Nature Strike can be used every other round and commanding large groups of beasts using Band of Beasts can be performed every day. If you stay in the same roundabout area, such as a forest or a valley, all your beast subjects will come to you when your kingdom comes under siege. This could mean the destruction of habitat, hunting on a large scale or particularly ominous creatures moving in.

While a creature is infected, you get a +2 bonus on skill checks made against it. You also know the direction they are from you. You can infect up to 5 people at once. Infecting more forces you to decide to free another. You can remove an infection as a free action. This infection can be identified and removed with a medicine check (DC=class DC). 1 - Power Up (Su) You don't just grow mushrooms, you become the mushroom. Every day you can grow 3 mushrooms on your body that contain magic within them that is unleashed when plucked and eaten. The magic is chosen when they are plucked. Plucking and eating/feeding is a single swift action. You can choose to grow new mushrooms with new powers on the following days, but growing new ones drains the magic from the old ones.\\ Mushrooms can be preemptively plucked and handed out to allies so they don’t need to be next to you to consume. In addition to spreading your infection, the mushrooms can have the following effects… Mega Mush [buff]Grow to huge size (1 minute)Mini Mush [buff]Shrink to tiny size (1 hour)Metal Mush [buff]Gain DRA 2 and resistance to poise damage.

Any situation that could benefit from being of a privileged class grants you advantage on skill checks, such as getting into an exclusive party, seeing real royalty etc. Lasts until rest.Return to Fungus [poly, true] [dismissable]You transform into inanimate fungus. You can transform into a very large stalk, or as many smaller fungi grouped together as appropriate. You maintain you senses, but can take no actions or move other than to revert to your original form.

You can choose to leave behind a trail of these tiny toadstools behind when you while you walk. 2 - Resonant Spores You can telepathically communicate to any creatures infected by your spores. 2 - Puffed Up (Su) 1/minute when you fall below half hp, you release a cloud of toxic gas within a 10 ft radius. While within the gas, creatures not infected by your spores are sickened 1 and have blurred vision. These effects persist for 1 round after leaving the cloud. 3 - Shiny \\[Light] As a swift action, you can cause your creations to glow with bio luminescence. Any creatures you have infected with spores as well as any mushrooms you create with Power Up or Mush Touch glow with a bright light in a 5ft radius. This isn't particularly useful in bright places, but in darkness it can light the way.\\ Glowing creatures take a -5 penalty to stealth and cannot use darkness to hide. 4 - Decomposition (Su) \\[Recharge] You can cause dead or decaying organic matter to be overtaken by fungus and accelerate the decomposition process. This can be used to target things like corpses, fallen trees and leaves, or even wooden doors. This typically has the effect of damaging the structural integrity of the object. For something like a small wooden barrier, it only takes a few rounds. For something much larger like a wall or an enormous fallen tree, it can take minutes. This provides sustenance to you, and this limits its usability. Decomposing something about your size like a door is more like a snack, but a particularly large object like an ornate wooden staircase is like eating a feast all on your own. You may need to wait until you are hungry again to fully decompose such objects. 4 - Mush Men (Su) \\[mana burn] \\[scrying] By spending 1 mana, you can animate a tiny mushroom to have little legs and eyes. They perish if attacked, have a speed of 30 and use your perception/stealth scores. You can give them telepathic orders, but they can do little more than keep watch or wander in general directions. They will mentally alert you (waking you up) if you they see something unusual, like an intruder, or something dangerous/scary. You can teach them a specific creature if you wanted them to find someone or something in specific. If they touch a creature, they can transfer your infection. This is usually only possible against incapacitated, friendly or willing creatures. Against an unwilling creature, you must succeed on a melee attack against a DD creature (uses your attack bonus). You can scry through the mushmen. You cannot recover the mana as long as the mushman persists, even if you rest. If the mushman returns to you safely, you recover the mana burn. If it dies, you must rest to restore it. You can willingly dismiss a mu 5 - Absorb When you get the wet condition, you increase 1 size category instead. Further applications of wet apply normally.

A dangerous and toxic mushroom pops out of your hand and relentlessly follows them for 1 minute. It flies at a speed of 30 at the end of each of your turns, moving in a direct line towards its target. This can lead to the mushroom getting \"caught\" on solid terrain. If it ever enters the space of the target creature, or if another enemy enters its space, it is immediately infected. The creature then takes d6/lvl poison damage (fort halves) and is dazed for 1 round. 10 - 1-Up (Su) \\[healing] \\[recharge] Make a mushroom that you can feed to a creature that has died in the last minute to restore them to 1 hp.

This information is one of the few things: A random piece of personal information (such as a love interest), something that weighs heavy on the creature's mind (such as upcoming important events) or the creature itself (as per one section of monster lore).

Creatures can pass through it freely, but attacks, spells, offense traits, thrown objects, weather effects and plenty of other things cannot. Any AoE effects are halted along the barriers edge. Even persistent ones like darkness or wall of fire are cut off. Whichever side of the barrier had more of the effect is where it persists. In general, creatures on opposite sides of the barrier have line of sight, but do not have line of effect.",

Their swift action is incredibly valuable, and can be spent in a number of ways that are powerful in their own ways. 1 - Panache Gain a pool of 5 points to use your class features with that replenishes each day.&#x20; Regain panache when you perform the following actions.\\ \\>Succeed on a gambit (5)\\ \\>Willingly provoke an AoO from a non minion enemy with your actions (1)\\ \\>Roll at least 10 higher than an enemy's AC and crit a non minion enemy (1)\\ \\>Defeat a non minion enemy (1) 1 - Parry and Riposte With a light weapon in your main hand and a buckler in your offhand, you can parry at any time. If you choose to use an unarmed strike or natural attack, you need a buckler in your off hand and a completely free main hand.\\ Parry functions in 2 different ways. Prepare to Parry - You can choose to forgo any number of attacks during your turn. Until the start of your next turn you can parry as an instant action a number of times equal to the number of attacks you decided to forego. If you successfully negate an attack, you can riposte and make a melee attack against the creature as an instant action. Reactive Parry - You can attempt to parry an attack without preparing by spending 2 panache. If you successfully negate an attack, you can riposte make a melee attack against the creature as an immediate action. If your foe attacked with a ranged attack, or with a weapon that has the reach property, you can only retaliate if they are within your reach. You can parry without a buckler, but take a -4 penalty to attack when you parry. 1 - Practiced Duelist You get a +4 bonus on bluff checks to feint, and an equal bonus on insight checks to resist feint.\\ You can feint as a swift action. By spending 1 panache as a free action, you gain advantage.

While not a secret language, it is incredibly difficult to understand despite it only being a modified version of common. A creature must be trained in linguistics to see past the many layers of slang that typify pirate lingo. 2 - Charmed Life The first time you use luck each round, it doesn't take an action.\\ By spending 1 panache, you can reroll a save as an immediate action. 2 - Dodging Panache \\[elusive] By spending 1 panache as an immediate action, gain a +4 bonus to ac against a single attack and move 5 ft. If this puts you out of the AoE of an effect, it has no effect against you. 4 - Superior Feint As a standard action, automatically feint a creature. It is feinted for all allies as well until the end of your next turn. 6 - Focus You can take the focus action as a swift action. While you focus, you get a +4 bonus to...\\ \\> AoOs made against this creature\\ \\> Reflex saves against the creature's acrobatics\\ \\> Perception against this creature 8 - Special Attack: Targeted Strike By spending 1 panache, choose a specific body part to target to gain a bonus effect (fort negates).

HeadConfuse the target for one roundTorsoStagger the target for one roundNeckThe target bleeds for 2d8 (9) damageLegsThe target is knocked downWingsThe target is grounded for one round 11 - Child's Play Reactive parry requires only 1 panache.

You can procure a specific item a creature once owned that someone mentions they misplaced, so long as you have been to a location it could be reasonably located.\\ Ex. \"Oh you guys went into Old Man's Cave? I remember going there once. Lost my wedding ring there.\"\\ \"This wouldn't happen to be it would it?\" You can't use it to proactively search for something, like a secret entrance, or a sacred artifact, unless an ancient resurrected hero is missing their sword and it was last seen in a place you’ve been (and it wasn't closely guarded). This doesn't let you retrieve items that are in someone else's possession and the DM can choose to deny particularly unlikely circumstances. Recharges every Monday. 4 - Mommy Energy You exude a palpable aura of love. Creature's find it difficult to harm you. Creatures who attempt to harm you must redirect their aggression for the remainder of their turn (will negates). This does not consume the action, but it does force them to alter it, such as attacking another creature, or excluding you from an AoE. Once a creature passes their save, or you deal damage, mom is on the menu and this aura is gone. 6 - Support+ Mom can remove tier 2 afflictions with emotional support. 11 - Support+ Mom can remove tier 3 afflictions with emotional support.",

They promote treating creatures with mercy whenever possible, and in the most extreme examples, can make death impossible. Their aura is powerful enough that existing near them makes you safer. 1 - Aura of Mercy (Su) Gain a 10ft aura in which creatures cannot gain stacks of Doom. Enemies also do not die when defeated in this aura. This aura is suppressed when you are defeated, or activated/deactivated as a free action on your turn. This aura has a distinct, personalized visual component that interferes with stealth. 1 - Lucky Break You add your luck as a bonus to all healing effects. You can add luck to a roll an ally makes as an immediate action if they are within your aura of mercy. You still cannot add luck twice (ie you both add luck to the roll). 1 - Compassion (Su) \\[mind affecting] When you use Channel Energy, enemies in range that were aggressors/not acting in self-defense are pacified for 5 rounds (will negates). They get a new save at the end of their turns if you or your allies take aggressive actions versus their allies, and it ends immediately if you or your allies take aggressive actions towards them. If there are no enemies left, initiative ends, and this ability can be extended for up to 10 minutes as long as you try resolving the conflict peacefully. 2 - Cure (Su) \\[healing] When you use healing touch, creatures get a new save against any lingering effects that would normally give additional saves (such as poison and some fear effects). Does not apply to permanent status like curses or drain. 2 - Endure Elements (Su) Creatures that touch your aura of mercy receive a blessing for 1 hour. This blessing allows them to exist inside of otherwise hazardous environments without harm. Blessed creatures ignore environmental effects like toxic volcanic gas, thin air at extreme heights, extremes in temperature, the vacuum of space or the pressure/lack of air in underwater environments. This does not make you immune to hazardous weather, such as hail, windstorms, lightning, quicksand etc. Only passive effects that prevent you from existing. 4 - Mystic Door (Su) \\[teleportation] When you rest in a settlement of at least 100 people, you can mark one of the doorways, portals, or similar entrance in the place you rested as your Mystic Doorstep. Until you rest again, as long as you are within 10 miles of the place you slept, you can conjure a Mystic Door that links to the Mystic Doorstep for one minute. It is the same size as the entry you marked. It takes one minute to cast. Any creature can take the portal back simply by walking through it, but it is one-way. Once the Mystic Door disappears, so does your Mystic Doorstep. This effect does not require line of sight. 4 - Dispel (Su) \\[recharge] As a standard action, touch a creature. On an ally, one harmful spell or supernatural effect immediately ends, unless it is permanent. On an enemy, this functions as Dispel Magic. For cursed items, this allows the safe removal of the item, but requires a caster level check. This has a 10 minute unique cooldown. 6 - Blessing of Restoration (Su) \\[healing] You recover from all stacks of drain every time you rest, regardless of conditions. As a standard action, you can touch a creature to absorb 1 stack of drain from them and you become drained 1. A creature can only be affected by this once each week. 8 - Elemental Protection (Su) Gain resistance to a non-physical damage type. Allies in your aura also gain this. You can change what you're resistant to by spending 10 minutes adjusting your magic. 10 - Angel Ray (Su) Your Holy Arrow has its range increased by 10. 11 - Benediction (Su) Creatures you heal with channel energy benefit from dispel (ignoring the cooldown), and can make a simple attack as an instant action.",

If you don't have the elemental blast feature, your blast damage is (d6+d6/odd lvl). \\ Pyrotechnics - You gain a technique point in the pyromancy tree. You can select this boon multiple times.\\ Dubstep Ignite \\[recharge] - When a creature survives one of your attacks with 5 or less hp, you know.

      "content": "Actor An actor is not merely a performer. These jesters use their voice and appearance to cause confusion in all but the most perceptive bunch. Throw your voice and rapidly change who you are on a dime to make people think they are interacting with many people. Actors can pull all kinds of ridiculous stunts to get them into and out of trouble. 1 - Everyone, Everywhere, All at Once (Su) Your proficiency in disguise is unmatched. You make a disguise as a swift action. Not only that, but you can be two people at once! This typically only functions with a singular person. You can change appearances and positions such that as long as both of your disguised personas are not visible at once, you can effectively inhabit both of them. In such scenarios you typically cause people to keep turning around to face whoever is speaking.&#x20; 1 - Throw Voice You are constantly under the effects of ventriloquism. It does not have the buff tag. You can have your voice originate from a place you cannot see, such as around a corner or as a muffled voice inside of a chest. 1 - Professional With proper venues, you can use disguise to make money as thought using a profession. Talents Gain one each even level. Numbers next to the name are level requirements. 2 - I Yield, I Yield! You can roll deception as an immediate action when you fall below (10+2\\*lvl) hp to pretend as though you have lost the will to fight. The inflicting creature or their leader within 30 ft roll opposed insight. If you succeed, they ignore you until rejoin the fight. When you do, the first creature you attack is DD. 2 - Flesh Wound/Deadly Wound You can exaggerate how painful something was, or make it seem as though something did not hurt at all. Roll deception or disguise (opposed by perception, insight or medicine) and you can play off a deadly wound as though it was nothing, even if it defeated you. In such a case you are still unable to perform actions, but your speed while defeated is not reduced. You can also do this when you take a relatively insignificant amount of damage to try and garner sympathy, or to convince a third party the attacker was trying to kill you etc. 2 - Statuesque You can use disguise to appear as a statue. While a statue, you cannot move or perform any actions, and otherwise functions as hide in plain sight. 2 - Traditional Theater You can stir up a commotion to gather attention, only to hit your audience with some of the most mind-numbingly boring or awful performances they have every seen. When you begin your performance, decide whether you want to make it boring or cringe to decide its effects. Boring performances put audiences to sleep and cringe ones make them run to the hills (will negates). The creature with the highest will save is the one to roll a collective save for the audience. They are the brave audience member willing to break the audience's silence and boo you off the stage, snapping the rest of the audience out of it. 4 - Sorry, Not Sorry You can harm or inconvenience someone without consequence. By first feigning assistance with a particular task, you can use it as an excuse to destroy items, spill beverages and overall show off how incompetent you can be. Creatures roll insight/perception (or perhaps even profession!) opposed to your disguise or deception. If you succeed, they are upset, but there are no immediate repercussions and you are just a waiter who fades into the background. Failure indicates a more intimate grilling and consequences appropriate for your misdeeds. You can attempt to do this repeatedly to the same person, but you have disadvantage on your skill checks. 4 - Auction House You can make the description of an item so tantalizing, so incredible that they must have it. During conversation, you can gloss up a particular item. You don't even need to possess the item, but it does need to exist. You can roll deception to exaggerate its quality, value or even function. If the creature fails its insight check, it immediately runs off to go find this item, or tries to get it from you. With this feature, you can essentially use deception as a profession skill to generate money. However you will damage your reputation by doing so.",

      "content": "Mime You have to feel it to believe it. Mimes are exceptionally good at making the precise hand and body movements to convince others that what their gestures imply exist really do. So much so that they won't believe it when they actually do! 1 - Pantomime (Su) \\[concentration] \\[mana burn] You can create objects out of thin air. Said objects must relatively simple and fit within a 10x10x10 ft cube. You can mime a flat wall, but you can't make a rat maze. You can mime a long rope, but you cannot mime a pulley system. Miming requires a standard action. Outside of these limitations, you can do anything. Let your imagination run wild as you mime staircases, simple tools and all kinds of other things into existence at your convenience, and your enemies' inconvenience. 1 - Practiced Routines (Su) A mime has a few routines that require significantly less strain in order to manifest. These specific uses of pantomime do not have the \\[mana burn] tag, but are more limited in scope. Each use costs 1 mana. You gain the \"build a wall\" practiced routine and another of your choosing at level 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. Build A Wall - You cause a flat 10x10 invisible wall to appear perpendicular to the direction you gesture. A creature cannot pass through it without a successful will save. Once a creature succeeds, all others make the save with advantage. If the initial creature fails, all others have disadvantage until one passes. Omnitool - You can pantomime a mundane tool, such as a fishing rod, a pick axe or a hammer. It only functions while in your hands, but otherwise functions as expected.\\ Lasso - You can pantomime rope, tying it around objects and using it as a lasso to hook around distant objects. There is no limit to how long you can make it, but it must be one continuous string. Other creatures can use the rope if they see you pantomiming it.\\ Binoculars - You put your hands over your eyes to enhance your vision. You can see distances hundreds of feet away with much greater detail.\\ Finger Gun - You can point at someone with your thumb in the air and move your thumb down to touch your index finger to \"fire\" at them. The creature takes 2d8+CL (9+CL) psychic damage (will halves). You can \"upcast\" this ability as though it were a spell, adding an additional d8 (4) of damage per additional mana spent. 1 - Speechless You can cast spells without verbal components. 2 - Charades \\[mind-affecting]&#x20; You can use your pantomiming skills to cause creatures to say things they might not normally say out loud. In neutral and friendly scenarios, you can start a game of charades. Choose one creature in particular to be your victim, then create an elaborate pantomime that causes them to say something in specific (will negates). This could be something silly like \"Colonel Mustard in the library with a candle stick\" or something more nefarious like \"those disgusting green immigrants.\" Pass or fail, when you initiate this goading charade, the game ends as a result of awkwardness or everybody else getting discouraged at your weird pantomime. The response is generally limited to a short sentence. Creatures subject to this ability cannot be subject to it again until you rest.&#x20; 4 - Silent Theater You gain silence and silencing strike as innate techniques.\\ By spending 2 mana, you can cast silence as a swift action on yourself.",

      "content": "Prankster Pranksters are the most ridiculous type of jesters. They are capable of doing things people typically might expect from cartoons. Taking your eyes off of them for just a second is a sure fire way to let them get away. They use incredible feats of acrobatics and sleight of hand in order to troll their enemies&#x20; 1 - Pranked! As a swift action, you can perform a prank. What this entails varies based on what kind of prank you choose.&#x20; Slipping and Sliding - Pull out your banana peels and oil slicks. Toss one into a creatures space or into an empty space. It persists until cleaned up. The creature you tossed the prank at, and any creatures that later move into this space are knocked down (reflex negates).\\ Realistic Replicas - As long as nobody has direct line of sight of you, you can manufacture a dangerous and silly prank. You cover up a door, you hide a switch or you paint a cave into a wall with exceptional speed. A creature must roll perception against your sleight of hand or they don't realize the deception. They are immediately subject to a dirty trick, as though you had poise broken them, and they take 2d6+lvl (7+lvl) damage of an appropriate type.\\ Lemon Chaser - Throw some fuel on the fire to bring the pain. In this case, the fuel is citrus juice and the fire is an opponent within reach. If the creature is not damaged, this does nothing. If the creature is missing, hp, the creature becomes sickened 1 from the intense pain (fort negates). If they are bleeding, they instead become sickened 2 (fort halves).\\ Flower Power \\[recharge] - You activate a pocket ornament, allowing you to spray an unsuspecting foe. You make a creature within reach wet. Usable 1/combat. 1 - Uncontainable While you are trapped inside of a room, or a cage, cell etc, you automatically escape the moment someone doesn't keep an eye on your for at least one full round (or 6 seconds). You can never tell people how because a magician never reveals his secrets. 1 - Kinesthetic Learner Instead of disguise and deception, you gain proficiency and a +4 bonus with acrobatics and sleight of hand. Talents Gain one each even level. Numbers next to the name are level requirements. 2 - Juggling As long as your hands are open and you do not wear a shield, you can effectively wield 3 different items at a time, provided each one could normally be used with one hand. You can add an additional item to the mix every even level.&#x20; You can also choose include random objects on your person, or that you pick up. Creatures cannot take these items from you unless they successfully disarm you. If you are ever stunned or dazed, you stop juggling, and you can choose what items you still hold in hand. 2 - Balancing Act As a swift action, you can roll acrobatics to jump directly onto a creature, balancing on their shoulders, back etc (reflex negates). When you jump on and at the start of your turn while you are balancing on a creature, they are made clumsy 1. You can be removed by poise breaking, or anything that forcefully moves you from your position. Any AoE effect that targets you also targets the creature you balance on. 2 - Make them Disappear! Given 3 rounds of setup, you can plan an elaborate ruse. Using mirrors, conveniently camouflaged hidey holes and hidden compartments in boxes, you can appear to make creatures completely disappear. The creature with the highest perception bonus in a group of onlookers rolls perception opposed by your sleight of hand. If you succeed, then the creature you choose can slip away undetected for the next minute. After the minute is up, people catch on, realize it isn't a joke etc and start the search...If they care. 2 - Vanishing Act (Su) Whenever you take damage, you have a 33% chance to disappear from sight in a cloud of smoke, deflating or something equally unusual, rendering you invisible until the start of your next turn. I recommend making effects like this a high roll. AKA a 5 or 6 on a d6. 2 - All Hot Air (Su) Take a deep breath, stick your thumb in your mouth and blow on it as a swift action. Doing so causes your body to expand in delightfully silly ways.\\ Belly - Inflate yourself. Just like a balloon. This gives you a 10 ft fly speed as long as you hold your breath and perform no actions other than movement.\\ Brain - Big brain time. You gain a +2 bonus to the next intelligence based check you make this round.\\ Hand - Increase the size of your hand. Your next unarmed strike this turn adds (d6/odd level) damage.\\ Assets - Attempt to charm a creature (will negates). They have a +4 bonus on the save if they wouldn't normally be attracted to you due to sexual orientation (or lack thereof for something like a robot). In combat the charmed creature gets a new save every turn. Out of combat the charm lasts 10 minutes, and once it wears off, the creature cannot be charmed again until rest. 4 - Squashed (Su) You gain a special attack. Flatten - Smush a creature against the ground with such force that they are practically rendered two-dimensional. The creature has their speed reduced by 15 and their reach reduced to 5 ft. This lasts until an ally uses the aid action on them, or the creature spends a standard action.\\ The damage of this attack is changed to bludgeoning. It deals your level in additional damage. You can use this special attack on your allies or yourself in order to slip underneath things like doors. You can much more easily hide underneath furniture etc. Allies take no damage from this attack and can exit their smushed state as a swift action.",

Some choose to do so with prestidigitation, drawing the eyes of creatures where they want, and more importantly, away from where they don't. Others use their voices and costumes to have a 3 way conversation with only themselves and their poor victim. One should always keep their eyes on a jester and their goals, for the moment they don't, they might just disappear. {% tabs %} {% tab title=\"Art\" %} Art by BasedBinkie {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Basic Stats\" %} Requires Archetype | HP (mixed) | 20(+8 per level) | | ---------- | ---------------- | | Poise | 6 | | Skills | 4 | | Save | Will | | Memory | 2+(2\\*lvl) | {% endtab %} {% endtabs %} 1 - Technique Specialization (Mixed) You gain 2 technique points at level 1, then another point every 2 levels after.\\ These technique points can be used on the scoundrel and moogen trees. Characters with magical specialization gain points in wild card equal to their highest tier of magic technique and 6 cantrips.\\ Characters with martial specialization gain points in warfare equal to their highest tier of martial technique. 1 - Master of Deception You get proficiency in the disguise and deception skills, with a +4 bonus. You also gain the Signature Skill feat for disguise. You start play with a disguise kit. 1 - Fight Dirty As a swift action, you can make a special type of attack against an enemy. Mockery \\[psychic] - Deal (d4+lvl) psychic damage to a creature within 30 ft and give them disadvantage on their next attack roll (will halves dmg and negates disadvantage). If you can personalize the insult to an extent the GM determines it digs deep, the DC is 2 higher.\\ Disarm - Roll a disarm attack. In additional to its usual effects, roll base weapon damage, unless a technique already does so.\\ Trick - Roll a dirty trick attack. In additional to its usual effects, roll base weapon damage, unless a technique already does so. 1 - Cutting Words \\[recharge] Roast your enemies, causing them to falter when it matters most. As an immediate action, you can force a creature within 30 ft to subtract a d6 to a d20 roll (minus luck checks). At level 6 this increases to d8. At level 10 this improves to d10. This ability can be used once per minute. You can ignore the recharge time and use it again if you \\[mana burn] 2. 2 - Jack of All Trades Add 1+½ lvl to all skills that you lack proficiency in. You can make checks for all skills as though you were proficient.\\ You also have the unique ability to perform any skill in unconventional (and sometimes nonsensical) ways. This could mean using strange tools, using your feet instead of your hands and adding superfluous steps for added flare. 2 - Hidden Props (Su) After a minute of scheming with an item in direct contact with you, you can make sure that this item is always there when you need it. This item must be something you can carry and must fit within a 5x5x5ft cube. You can only have one hidden prop at the ready at a time. You procure these items by pulling them out of hidden hatches, around corners or from behind someones ear. If it is a handheld object (like a trumpet or a sword), this requires no action. Anything larger requires a swift action. These items effectively do not exist as long as you have them as hidden props. They cannot be stolen from you and they do not exist in a specific place. They exist wherever it is most convenient for the jester at any given moment, making other creatures unable to interact with them if you believe it inconvenient. If you are killed, the items fall out of your pocket. Nonlethal methods of retrieving these items against the jester's will require charms, curses and the like. 2 - Audience Plant \\[recharge] There is a secret network of jesters, their assistants and their fans that all work to aid each other. As long as you are in a situation where there are others present but not currently in sight (such as a person in a nearby shop, or guards in the adjacent room), you can give a signal to have them act. Depending on the type of signal, you can have them act differently. Cause a Commotion - The plant will cause a ruckus by shouting, playing music and being obnoxious. At the very least, it will momentarily draw the attention of creatures so you can hide (or something similar).\\ Vouch For Me - A random member of the crowd cheers for you, or a prison guard tells their coworker to lay off you a bit. This isn't enough to get you out of situations, but will likely give people pause before inflicting any form of harsh judgement.\\ Oops? - The plant will \"accidentally\" do something, like opening a window in the way of someone chasing you, or unlocking a door for you to let you inside. In order to recharge this ability, you have to return the favor in some way to the person that assisted you after the situation resolves itself. Usually if you remain in the area, they will come to find you. 4 - Status Quo (Su) Spend 1 minute familiarizing yourself with an area. You can interact with an environment, including moving things, painting things, destroying things etc. Then as a standard action while nobody is looking, you can cause it to revert back to its original state, sans minor details like you stealing items from a safe, or adding a few innocuous items. You can do this even if you are not present. You can intuitively tell when nobody is looking and you can use this ability.",

The first time you are harmed by one of your own spells in combat, gain a luck dice. A luck dice can be used to reroll any d20 Roll you make. If you use anything to reroll a natural one, or have advantage and don't roll multiple 1s, you do not gain a luck dice. You can have an unlimited number of luck dice. With many saved up you hum/glow with power. At the start of each day if you have zero luck dice, gain one. 1 - Wild Magic Whenever you cast a (non cantrip) spell, roll a DC 5 luck check. If you fail, roll on the wild magic table for a bonus effect. Every time you pass this luck check, increase the DC by 2. When wild magic triggers, reset the DC back to 5. Triggering wild magic is the only way to reduce the DC of this luck check. The effect always triggers after the casting of the spell has been resolved. 2 - Lucky Number Roll a d8+1. This number permanently becomes your lucky number. Whenever you roll this number on a d20, you gain a luck dice and you treat the result as 10 higher. 2 - Refund \\[recharge] Every even level you can replace one of your spells known with another spell.\\ By donating 1,000 gold to a frog, you can instantly replace a spell known 1/day. 4 - Certified Expert You have advantage on skill checks and serendipity checks as long as nobody is watching you. 6 - Wilder Magic (Su) As an immediate action, spend a luck dice to force a creature casting a spell within 30 feet of you to roll on the wild magic table.\\ Usable 1/minute without spending a luck dice. 8 - Crazy Talk You say a lot of weird things, but sometimes trapped in the madness is a grain of truth. Once per game session, you can will practically anything to be true, though how true it is varies. First you make your intention to the DM to be known. \"I'm good friends with the royalty in this town.\" \"There is a secret entrance into the base through this cave.\" \"There's someone on the other side of this door\" right before you blow it up. How true it becomes depends on what the bronze senses are tingling over. Being friends with royalty is unlikely, so its much more likely you're friends with the banished prince. There may just be a secret entrance through the cave, but the tunnel has since collapsed, only allowing the smallest of creatures inside. Someone being directly on the other side of a door is context based, but in the right scenario could possibly catch your enemies off guard.&#x20;",

By simplifying complex truths into easy to understand proverbs, you can give your allies a unique perspective. 1/day you can dispense your knowledge as a standard action to a creature within reach. When the proverb finally clicks, you give your ally a reroll on a skill check of their choosing. If they do not use it by the time they rest, the wisdom is lost. 4 - Deep Breath At the start of your turn if you are shaken, confused, frightened or under some type of charm/possession effect, you can choose to immediately end all of those effects as a swift action by spending 2 mana. 4 - Healing Hand (Su) \\[healing] \\[overheal] Knock bones into place and relax muscles with a quick jab.

To you it weighs nothing, but to anybody else it weighs 200 lbs full and 20 empty. Your keg is enough to last you a week before you must return to civilization and craft a refill. With an empty keg, you cannot chug. If you spend 3 days crafting, you can fill your keg with moonshine. 1 - Chug \\[recharge] \\[healing] Take a swig to grant yourself (4+½ lvl) temp hp.

Any turn you chug, you only have access to one of your hands while the other is used to shotgun your drink from the keg. Chug has a unique form of cooldown. See tip below for more details. {% hint style=\"success\" %} You must use a form of alcohol processing in order to begin recharging chug, after which it is on cooldown for 1 round. A helpful way to remember if you can chug is to recall what you did last round.

Rest and Digest \\[healing] - As a free action, heal equal to your remaining temp hp from chug (up to 75% max hp, any remaining after is wasted.) If you have no temp from chug remaining, you can still use this ability, but it provides no healing and only recharges chug.

The variety tends to come from how integrated it is into the mechanics themselves, such as a vehicle they pilot or a suit that augments themselves. This mech can be sundered, lowering the DC of class abilities that are dependent on it by 2.\\ When you are defeated, this mech becomes unusable and requires repairing. This requires a (30-engineering roll) minutes (minimum 1) and appropriate tools. If you ever lose this mech, you can recreate it in (30-engineering roll) days (minimum 1) and 200g of materials like metals and comfy leather seats. Unless otherwise noted, all class features only function while mounted on mech. 1 - Charge Mechs have many powerful abilities that require the mechanic to gather power. This always has some kind of distinct audio and visual quality, such as revving engines, glowing chassis, steam erupting from every nook and cranny etc. You automatically fail stealth checks when charging, and creatures get a +20 bonus to perception to notice you when charging.

While it is deactivated, it leaves behind large, distinct tattoos that look like wires, power sources or something similar behind.

The creature speaks in its own voice, but otherwise moves and interacts with the physical world via your body.&#x20; Whether or not a spirit is interested in speaking changes drastically from person to person. Some spirits will be happy to be able to speak with loved ones, and others will immediately leave at the sight of a past enemy. A persuasion check is usually in order before the spirit leaves. The spirit is mostly limited to only what they knew in life, and they are still able to fully articulate their thoughts as though they were of sound mind. Little information about the Mortal Realm passes into the Underworld, and less still reaches the ears of the average spirit. 8 - DoD: Soul Cage (Su) As an immediate action when a creature dies within 60 ft of you, you can choose to seal the creatures soul inside of a staff you wield. A tiny spectral cage forms at its tip with a miniature version of the creatures spirit inside. Until the staff is sundered, the cage is opened with sleight of hand, or you cage a new soul, the spirit is trapped inside of your staff. While trapped the spirit remains conscious and can perceive the world around it as it did in life. You can converse with the spirit, and you can silence it if it gets to loud. 11 - Overlord When you animate dead, you can choose to set its level to 3 and have it not consume a companion slot. You are allowed to give it a singular order at the time of creation that it fulfills until it is destroyed.",

On-hit apply a tether linking you and the target creature. At the end of your turn it takes 2d6+CL (7+CL) necrotic damage and you heal an equal amount. This tether lasts 3 up to 3 rounds. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from you, the tether breaks. When you miss, or when the tether breaks, this ability cannot be used again on your next 3 turns. 1 - Death Defied (Su) \\[recharge] When you are defeated, you can instead choose not to be. Your body vanishes and transforms into an incorporeal and invincible spirit version of yourself, cleansing all non-permanent status. While in this form you can continue to float around the battlefield with a 30ft hover speed. At the end of your 4rd turn defying death, you return to life at 50% of your max hp. While in this form you can move and speak, but you can only take 2 actions: melee attack, or drain hope. They have unique effects while defying death. Melee attacks reduce a creatures speed by 15 on hit, but deal no damage. Drain hope immediately recharges, and has its resource cost removed. It does not deal damage or heal you, but for each round you drain, you return to life 1 turn sooner. After you use death defied, you acquire a unique T3 affliction. Hades' Watchful Eye - You cannot use death defied. Cure - You must pay your respects to the god of death. This requires performing a 1 week ritual in a place of worship dedicated to Hades, or spending 1 week tidying up places where the dead are kept. 1 - Bonk The first time you land a melee attack each round, gain a stack. When you have 2 stacks, you get access to a unique special attack. Special Attack: Bonk - Get a +10 bonus to attack. All creatures within 10 ft of the original target also take the attacks dmg. If no creatures are within 10 ft of the original target, deal an additional d6/odd lvl dmg. 2 - DoD: Wraith Walk (Su) \\[teleportation] You can let your spirit temporarily leave your body as a standard action. When you do, you immediately dash and become an invincible incorporeal spirit, similar to death defied. Your body remains in the position you used this ability from. At the end of your turn, your body teleports to the position of your spirit. 6 - DoD: Children of the Grave (Su) \\[curse] \\[companion] You can apply a curse to an enemy as a swift action. The curse has no effect until the creature is defeated or killed. When such condition is filled, its spirit briefly leaves its body and fights by your side. The spirit uses all of the creatures stats, but it can only use its multiattack, or make a single simple attack if it has none. It spawns with only 50% of its max hp and disappears after 1 minute. The spirit persists even if the creature recovers from the defeated condition or death. A spirit can only spawn from a creature once each day. If you are not present when the spirit is summoned, you receive a mental alert and can immediately begin \\[scrying] and control the spirit. If you already have 2 companion slots filled because of your undead, one is put in stasis until the spirit leaves. If you already have 2 companion slots from other sources, ~~play another class~~ this feature doesn't work. The curse is removed by touching a gravestone and saying \"F.\" 8 - Improved Wraith Walk You can use wraith walk as a swift action, and can maintain wraith form for up to 3 turns.

      "title": "curses",
      "content": "Curses The goal here is to create things that both have some kind of general mechanical benefit while also having some kind of role play to the curse. Child You’re just a kid. Those afflicted with the child curse can never grow up. They have the minds of someone much older than they appear mixed with an odd assortment of child-like tendencies and interests. Benefit - You are one size category smaller than what is normal for your race. Your apparent age cannot be magically altered, even through \\[polymorph] effects. Drawback - Whenever you try to appeal to authority to someone unfamiliar with your curse, you take a -2 penalty to any skill checks related. You take a -2 penalty to poise. Empathetic You love people. Those afflicted with the empathetic curse consider most people their friends, and find it difficult to treat others harshly, even those on the other side of the battlefield. Woe to he who makes an enemy of an empathetic oracle. Benefit - When you cast a spell or use an ability to restore hitpoints, it heals an additional 3 HP. Whenever you defeat a creature, they instead gain the time out condition. You can cause a creature that is defeated to automatically stabilize and not die as an immediate action. Drawback - You are physically unable to intentionally and knowingly kill living creatures, even when magically compelled to do so. If a creature within 30 feet of you is dying/bleeding out, you must at the very least stabilize them to prevent them from dying, using any actions you have available. Special - In scenarios where compulsively healing people equates to suicide (such as in a warzone) you can ignore the compulsion to save lives. Follower You live for someone else. Those afflicted with the follower curse have separation anxiety turned up to 11. Whoever they are bound to is burdened with the undying loyalty of their companion. Benefit - Choose another creature to form a permanent bond with. You can move in tandem with them if you have the movement. You can choose to be the target of a harmful effect targeting your bond as an instant action. If the effect is AoE and would target both of you, you can instead choose to automatically have them pass while you automatically fail. You get a +10 bonus to any skill checks related to your bond (heal checks to stabilize, perception to tell if someone is disguised as them etc). You can innately cast reincarnate (Frogg 2), but only targeting your bond. It also function on them if they are dead. Drawback - If you have not seen your bond for 1 minute, you are shaken 1. \\ If you have not seen your bond for 1 hour, you are shaken 3. \\ If you have not seen your bond for 1 day, you receive the prior penalties and cannot do anything other than search for them unless physically prevented from doing so. In the event you are shown convincing evidence that your bond is dead, you attempt to use resurrection magic to get them back. If that is impossible, you are shaken 3 for one week before you must select a new curse, or a new bond. Frenetic Can you quit moving? Those afflicted with the frenetic curse are excellent multitaskers. They’re always pacing around and touching things when they do anything. Benefit - You get +2 init and a +4 bonus to AC when provoking attacks of opportunity. Increase your base speed by 10. Drawback - You must move at least 10 feet every round. You cannot take 20. If you cannot move, you take 3 true damage at the end of your turn. Generous You love to give to others. Those afflicted with the generous curse always tip, always take the tab and will gladly buy things for others. Benefit - Any money that you donate to charity or pay with the curses drawback is put into a “good will” fund. At any time you can call upon this fund to have some non magic positive (and somewhat realistic) occurrence to happen of your choosing. For example you could have a pair of horses delivered to you in your hour of need, then subtract the cost of two horses from your fund. If you sell these gifts then your good will fund immediately depletes and goes negative equal to double the gold gained from selling the gifts. Drawback - Whenever you spend gold (not including your good will), you spend an additional 20% more gold to make whoever you’re paying happy. You cannot intentionally and knowingly steal money or possessions from others, or participate in plans to do so. Special - Some scenarios related to this curse are left up to interpretation. If you wanna make a cool heist mission where you're stealing from a tomb then you can realistically make an exception. But if you’re just casting buffs on a rogue while they rob people blind, that’s a no go. \\ Realistic for the benefit just means no milk delivery when cows are extinct. If the player can come up with a creative way to get what they want, then you should give it to them, or increase the cost. Honest You just can't help but speak the truth. Those afflicted with the honest curse are rarely trusted with secrets. Their honesty is seen as a virtue to many, but it gets them into trouble quite often when they suddenly start getting quiet, or worse, when they run their mouth. Benefit - When you surpass the DC of a sense motive check to detect if someone is lying by 5, they automatically blurt out the truth. Drawback - You cannot knowingly tell a lie. Not even a half-truth. You are compelled to answer questions to the best of your knowledge. The best you can do to not reveal your deepest secrets is to not speak at all. Horny Your mind is often filled with lustful thoughts. Those afflicted with the horny curse often tell dirty jokes and hit on anything with a pulse. Worse yet they tend to have deviant tastes. Benefit - You gain post nut clarity. After nutting/helping someone achieve nut, you may glean information from your intimate bond. You effectively ask a question and receive an answer in three or less words. The subject does not know you gleaned this information. Drawback - Your partner also gets to glean information with the same restrictions. You know what they gleaned. Identity Crisis Who are you? Those afflicted with the identity crisis curse are really good at not being themselves. Thoughtful parents give their lil’ curse bearers unisex names. Benefit - You can assume the form of any playable race with a duration of one hour 1/day. It doesn’t affect your racial features. You cannot choose to look like the other you (see drawback). Drawback - Every monday morning you wake up as a new person, swapping between two different people. In your head you’re still you, but you look completely different. You still stay the same race, but you swap genders, change size and shape, eye color, all the above and more! You take a -5 penalty to any skill check to convince someone that you're still you if they haven't experienced both yous a few times or aren't a close friend, family etc. Loner You just want to be alone. Those afflicted with the loner curse are physically drained when in the presence of other people, and thrive when left to their own devices. Confrontation is terrible, especially when they have to do the confronting. Benefit - You get a +2 bonus to AC and saving throws when you aren't being threatened and no allies are adjacent to you. When you aren't in the presence of other creatures you get a +2 bonus to skill checks. Something like a familiar, companion creature or a pet can be a reasonable exception. Drawback - You take a -2 penalty to any opposed skill check. You cannot benefit from or provide flanking and assist other bonuses. Mute You’d love to chat, if only you could. Those afflicted with the mute curse cannot speak, but are much better at developing intimate connections with those you physically interact with. Benefit - You can cast spells while silenced. You learn sign language as a bonus language. You can telepathically communicate via touch. Your communication happens simultaneously to all creatures touched. While in direct contact with someone, you have advantage on skill checks against them. Drawback - Whenever you spend gold (not including your good will), you spend an additional 20% more go Oblivious You have no idea how bad things really are. Those afflicted with the oblivious curse have things fly right over their heads all the time, sometimes to their benefit! Benefit - You get a +4 bonus versus fear effects. You get a +4 bonus to ac and saving throws until you act in combat. These bonuses stack. Whenever making a saving throw out of combat, also add these bonuses. Drawback - You take a -4 penalty on perception and sense motive. You do not gain perception as a skill. You cannot gain perception or sense motive as skills from any source. Possessed You share your body…Literally! Those afflicted with the possessed curse have another creature's spirit inhabiting their body. Luckily this spirit has a sense of self-preservation, but it does like having some personal space…Your personal space. Benefit - When you are stunned, paralyzed, unconscious or suffering from a similar kind of status effect that prevents you from acting, you can still do anything that only requires the use of a single arm (such as drink potions, swing a one-handed weapon or manipulate an object). You still cannot cast spells while CC’d. You have a speed of 5 feet while suffering from such conditions. Drawback - You only have access to one of your arms. Your off-hand cannot be used to wear a shield, wield a weapon or perform complex tasks that generally require two hands. SPECIAL - The DM and player should consider the creature that is possessing the limb and perhaps during special moments, or while doing something the possessor likes, the spirit concedes control of the limb to its original owner. Retrospective You’re always dwelling on the past. Those afflicted with the retrospective curse constantly reminisce about the great things that happened in their past. By the same token, the negative events that happen to them weigh heavy on their mind for much longer than most. Benefit - You are immune to effects that magically alter your memory. You recall everything you have ever experienced with perfect clarity. You can cast mirror movie (Larella 4) at-will (self only). Drawback - When you are suffering from an affliction, any numeric penalties are doubles. If it does not have a numerical penalty, it takes twice as long, or costs twice as much as normal to cure because the memory of your tragedies are so vivid. Racist You hate x people. Those afflicted with the racist curse generally have a disdain for creatures that don’t look and talk like them. They channel this distaste into hatred for a few in particular. Benefit - Choose 3 playable races. When in combat against them, increase your speed to 120. You have advantage on any opposed checks against these creatures, so long as such interactions can be considering \"unfriendly.\" (aka, no persuasion or something like it) Drawback - As long as a creature of this race is standing, you must end each of your turns threatening one if you are physically able. You must use all of your actions to harm and impede these creatures. If you can't, then dash to move closer to them. Twinned You're like brothers, only closer. Those afflicted with the twinned curse come with a +1. They have 2 heads and share control over the body. Benefit - You have a commoner attached to you that matches your level (see bestiary>humanoids). You have primarily control of your body and your head has no actions of its own, but can still sense normally and speak. This gives you access to 3 more skills, one of which must be profession, and potentially new race features. \\ As an instant action, your other head can shove you 5 ft 1/minute. They can also perform simple interactions such as grabbing things, opening doors etc using this same cooldown. Drawback - You must concede control of your body in order to use these bonus skills/race features. This requires a free action. Your other head can concede control similarly, or you can forcefully take control by making your other head pass a will save 1/minute. You can also shove them.\\ When your other head is in control it uses its own stat array, skill bonuses, racial features etc. This happens automatically while you are sleeping and the other head isn't, though most loud/physical activities will wake you up. Special - Because this curse requires cooperation, using it to fuse with enemies can be very challenging. Proceed with caution.",

      "content": "Fate Spinner Many people wish they could see the future, but the fate spinners are the only ones who truly understand the nature of this burden. Fate spinners are frequently humbled by their power to see into the future and the struggle to change it. You gain unique boons with drawbacks associated with them, and a deck of cards to twist fate with on a whim. {% hint style=\"info\" %} Class DC changes from Int to Luck&#x20; {% endhint %} Art Featuring Mollymauk from Critical Role by Electrocereal 1 - MM: Fortunetelling Draw a card from your deck as a swift action. See card results for more details. 1 - Cursed Fatespinners, oracles and the like tend to draw the ire from the gods for meddling with the future. They each suffer from a unique curse that provides them with unique challenges and benefits. See the curses section for more details. 1 - Oracle's Premonition \\[recharge] Your mind is plagued by visions of the future. During carefully curated rituals, speaking in tongues, wild highs on psychoactive drugs or delivered in dreams, you receive premonitions about future events. These premonitions generally focus on great tragedies soon to befall subjects that are relevant to you. This could be important people, places of significance, valuable artifacts, ancient evils and other such things. As far as fine mechanics go, the ritual requires at least one hour of uninterrupted concentration. Generally the subject of these premonitions are focused around a specific subject, sometimes of your choosing, sometimes not. The premonitions are not required to give a precise answer. This next part is as much for the DM as it is the player. As an example. You could divine things about the organization causing strife in this city.\\ \"Suddenly you are far away in the nation's capital city. You see brief flashes of the decorations of the summer festival, and a dark amorphous blob moving through the streets. You see many silhouettes moving into the kings castle. The only discernible detail you can see from them is an insignia on the hood of their robes. You hear a voice. 'Today is the day the tyrant is killed.' And then the vision transforms into a beautiful oasis filled with winged horses, before quickly fading.\" Some important takeaways… * You ALWAYS focus on the event, not the outcome. In order to be a premonition given to presumably change the future, the information must be actionable. (the king is danger!) * You ALWAYS know the WHEN of the event, down to the minute. Other details like where and who can be discovered. (its happening during the summer festival!) * You ALWAYS receive some kinds of sensory clues. Voices, symbols, colors, smells, temperature must be present. (robed figures with a noticeable insignia, some large black ooze and the voice of someone important) * You ALWAYS receive something that you can affect within the prescribed time. Either the vision tells you about something nearby,or the vision also includes similar types of clues for how you might get to these faraway places. (you'd never be able to get there in time…unless you could fly using a pegasus) As for the \\[recharge] tag. Depending on the pacing of your campaign, your premonitions might reveal information regarding events that are to happen within weeks, months or years. Generally a fate spinner should have a premonition once each major story arc. No matter what though, a fate spinner cannot have premonitions about a new subject before the events of his current premonition transpire. If you or your DM deem this ability too annoying or disruptive for play...gain an extra technique point and then another each odd level. 2 - Fated Fatespinners have an innate sense of how far they can push fate before fate pushes back. You gain a pool of 10 luck. Whenever you add luck to a roll, you can choose to add any amount of this luck pool to the roll. You can add this luck after you fail a check, with your GM telling you how much is needed to pass the check. This pool resets to 10 when you rest. You can push your luck, going negative up to 10 points. Whenever you do, you gain a unique affliction. T3 Affliction: Out of Luck - You cannot add luck to your rolls. Cure - Pay homage to the gods to make up for meddling in their affairs. You must do this a number of days equal to your negative luck pool when you gained this affliction. Paying homage can include spending time at a place of worship or assisting leaders of a religion. {% hint style=\"warning\" %} Note, because you can no longer add luck to rolls with this affliction, you also cannot use your fated luck pool. This means when you go negative, even if only -1, you cannot then later choose to go even more negative. {% endhint %} 4 - Threads of Fate You can see the silvery thread that floats above a creatures head, connecting them to the heavens above. This thread is loosely connected to other people, locations and objects. Unless a creature is also a fate spinner, you can wrap this thread around your finger without bringing much attention to yourself while within 10 ft of them, tethering you to the creature. While tethered... * You can always follow this thread to lead you to this person. The thread is ethereal and ignores physical terrain, leading in a direct line to this creature, causing potential problems when tracking someone in a dense building, underground or on the other side of world. * When in the presence of people, places or objects of significance to the creature, you can see faint threads connecting their tether to them. * The tethered creature remembers you very clearly from any previous encounter you had with them after you tethered to them, even events that happened before the tether. You can only tether to a single creature at a time, losing any previous ties if you tether a new creature.",

      "content": "Glass Reflection This ability comes online at level 1, and improves at levels 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. Level 1 By performing a 1 hour ritual using a reflective surface, such as a mirror or a pool of water, you can see and hear remote locations. To do so you must name a specific creature you have met personally (Zeus, Jake from State Farm, Boo the miniature giant space hamster). You see the target creature as though you were floating overhead, using your own senses (will negates). Your vision radius is limited to only 10 ft around the target, but you can hear things as though you were present. Passing a save against Glass Reflection (GR) gives the target an eerie feeling that they're being watched. Failing means they are unaware. Possessing a personal possession of the creature (a book, weapon, article of clothing) gives them a -2 penalty to their save. Possessing a piece of the creature, such as a hair or some of their blood, gives them a -4 penalty. These penalties do not stack. The range of this ability is finite. Generally speaking it should only function on creatures within city limits. This generally means it has a range of a few miles. You can spy on a creature for 10 minutes before the senor disappears. You can speak telepathically to creatures visible in your GR. You cannot target an unwilling creature with GR more than 1/day. A creature who has passed a save against your GR before always gets a perception check to see signs of magical spying with a DC (20+lvl) perception check when you initiate it. Without ways of interacting with magic they can do little to stop you, but they know you're there. By contacting a creature ahead of time (such as via sending), you can automatically scry on a willing target without accepting mana burn. The first use of Glass Reflection each day does not mana burn. Any effects that prevent or otherwise interact with \\[scrying] effects also interact with GR. Level 2 * You don't need to have personally met the target of your spying, but you do still need to know their name * The range of this effect increases to state. If you're within the same state, it works. This generally means a few dozen miles. * You get a +4 bonus to perception while scrying a creature * You gain nightvision during GR Level 4 * You no longer need to know the name of the creature you spy on, but you do need some kind of vague idea of who they are. Something like \"the guild leader of the Fox Force\" or \"the orc general\" suffices. * The range of this ability increases to country. This generally means hundreds of miles * You can spy on a creature for 1 hour * The GR ritual only takes 10 minutes Level 6 * The range of this ability increases to continent. This generally means a thousands of miles * The vision radius increases to 20ft around the target * You gain darkvision during GR * Creatures you have successfully GR'd before have disadvantage on saving throws and perception checks against GR Level 8 * You can use GR on creatures on the entire planet, other planets and other planes of existence * You can spy on a creature until you rest * The GR ritual only takes 1 minute Level 10 * The GR ritual only takes 1 standard action * The vision radius limit is removed completely * You are constantly under the effects glimpse of truth while using GR",

See the scrying tag for more details.\\ Assistant - Your companion can use the aid action to assist you for any skill checks.\\ To My Side \\[teleportation] - You can concentrate for 3 rounds to teleport your companion to your side. 2 - MM: Mind Touch When a creature fails a save against an effect you inflict, or you land an attack, you can affect the creature as though you had successfully cast detect thoughts on them as an immediate action. You briefly gain insight into their current plans, something that weighs heavily on their mind, or whatever seems most relevant at the time. Alternatively, you can roll a knowledge check (including monster lore) using the creatures bonus. You intuitively know what knowledge skills it possesses. 4 - MM: All-Seeing Eye Get a +2 bonus to perception. You can pluck out your eye as a standard action and have it hover around autonomously with a speed of 40 on each of your turns. It has a tether range of 300 ft. You can pop it back into your head as an instant action if it moves into your space. You can simultaneously see through both your eye and your detached eye without mental strain. The eye is blurry and insubstantial so it always has partial concealment. To perceive it, creatures need to make a DC 20 perception check, or DC 10+your stealth bonus. It shares all of your statistics and is treated as you for all targeting purposes. AoE effects targeting both you and your eye only affect you once. 6 - Innate Casting You are persistently under the effect of detect thoughts allowing you to always peer into the thoughts of others. It loses the concentration tag and gains the \\[buff] tag. If gain another buff, you can reactivate detect thoughts as a swift action. 1 - MM: Glass Reflection Thi",

      "content": "Disco Your psyche is fragmented, rendering some parts of your brain inaccessible. This allows them to develop thoughts on their own, and chime in with their own insights when the situation calls for it. As a result, disco psychics are able maintain multiple trains of thought, giving unique insights into situations that surpass leaps of logic and enter the realm of the supernatural. 1 - Compartmentalization Your mind is fragmented into 4 different parts: The self, the body, instinct and intellect. Each part of your mind is special in its ability to focus on specific things. * The self is related to charisma, and represents an aspect of yourself that gets along with others. Things such as cooperation, empathizing and commanding others. * The body is related to str/dex, and represents an aspect of yourself that interacts with material reality. Repairing or breaking things, flexing on people and sleight of hand. * Instinct is related to wisdom, and represents an aspect of yourself that can see the unseen. Things such as gut feelings and hunches. * Intellect is related to intelligence, and represents an aspect of yourself that knows information. Things such as logic, mathematics and knowledge. As an instant action before you roll a skill check, you can choose to add a d8 to it. If you fail the check, you lose a point of Mental Might. You cannot use this when you take 10/20. 1 - Invoke Psyche The fragments of your mind have much to say, but they can be pushed even further beyond. You can choose to invoke a particular fragment of your psyche. When you do spend a point of Mental Might. Roll a d8 and add the key ability score (choosing between str or dex as appropriate for the situation for the body). If the final result totals 6 or higher, you learn a far greater amount of information that you otherwise would have, or succeed in some other superlative fashion. If you fail, you glean nothing. For example if you invoke the self during a war meeting to convince an enemy to agree to an armistice you might get something like...\\ \"The general is in a very difficult position. All the posturing and propaganda surrounding the war could fall apart if he agrees to this armistice. Worse yet, he could appear weak to his people; A death sentence to any military career, and this mans ambitions are high. If you want to convince him to an armistice, you need to do so in a way that doesn't shatter his reputation. Perhaps you should bring up that common enemy you have both been on the hunt for.\" Another example if you invoke intellect in order to detect any patterns in an ongoing investigation on some wanted criminal you might get something like...\\ \"You are looking at the map and suddenly it all clicks. A circle! The attacks are all happening in cities along the outskirts in the country's territory. It reminds you of a much larger version of the circles you've seen with the cultists. The only part left of the circle is the center...The capital!\" In any case, you receive a large degree of information that might be available to your character, or can be gleaned from the clues you have seen up until this point, but might not click in your head as a player.&#x20; Your GM may want to assign bonuses or penalties based on circumstances. A -1 for previously insulting the general or +1 for studying the magic circles in a library to use the previous examples. {% hint style=\"warning\" %} The GM is the final arbiter in deciding whether or not you can invoke psyche at all. For example, you cannot invoke intellect to figure out who is the leader of a secret organization you know nothing about session 1. {% endhint %} 2 - Invocations You can invoke aspects of your psyche to perform incredibly unusual feats. You gain an invocation at level 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. Each one is color coded to decide which stat applies. Shivers - The wind holds omens of the future, and you can feel it. You always invoke shivers when you want to find something. When you successfully invoke instinct with shivers, you get insight into the type of place whatever it is you are looking for is. You usually must still put clues together in order to narrow it down. Schizophrenia - The world itself speaks to you. You always invoke schizophrenia on objects of great significance. When you successfully invoke schizophrenia, the chosen object speaks to you. The frame of time it does so varies, but it typically only does so for 1 sitting. The object can relay information about creatures that have interacted with it in the past, like a piano of a musician or a sword of an ancient hero.&#x20; Visualization - Reshape the scene. You always invoke visualization to piece together how something played out based on physical traces left behind. When you successfully invoke visualization, you can re-imagine an event as it happens, with the vague silhouettes of creatures and objects moving in real time to allow you to determine details like size, shape, sequence and direction. Activation - Start your engines. You always invoke activation in order to activate something. This could mean some kind of complex machine you normally couldn't make heads or tails of, how to open a door with no obvious handle or swing open a portcullis from outside of a fort. Activation may require a specific position or suitable tool to get full value. Mirror - Watch how it's done. You always invoke the mirror when you want to copy someone. You can mimic someones ability to quell an animal, speak a language or perform some type of skill. In any case, your mirror neurons can only do their magic if you have witnessed a creature in action within the last 10 minutes. You mimic the degree of success you witnessed, can speak the language for the duration of a conversation and otherwise temporarily mimic some behavior. Encyclopedia - Master of all trivia. You can invoke encyclopedia whenever you wish, and your brain produces random tidbits of information. When you succeed, you receive relatively detailed information about something specific, though it may not be what you were hoping for...Roll a luck check. Lets pretend you are walking around a museum cataloguing ancient monsters called \"Big Beasties\" * 1-6 - Your brain produces information completely unrelated to the situation at hand. Encyclopedia decides to inform you about a loving relationship between a lady and a giant ape. * 7-13 - Your brain produces information tangentially relevant to the situation at hand. Encyclopedia tells you about other large creatures that exist and how the specimens you're looking at stack up to them. * 14-20 - Your brain produces rather precise information about the situation at hand. Encyclopedia informs you about one of the specimens and its historical significance while it was still living.",

If it's a bit more complex, such as sneaking items into a location, you can expend resources to try and get it to happen, but may need to roll a skill check to have it be successful; otherwise, you lose any potential that you would have used attempting to succeed at that task. This ability has a cooldown of 5 minutes. Exceptionally cheap or mundane items/plans have no cooldown. 1 - Quick Thinking Gain a pool of D8 dice (1+1/2 lvl+Int) . These can be used on any physical ability check or skill check, saving throw, or attack roll, even after learning the results of the check to make it succeed retroactively.\\ This ability cannot be used to exceed what would otherwise be the maximum result (such as 28 for d20+8). 1 - Shrodinger's Pockets (Sp) While wearing any clothes with pockets, your inventory (that isn't exposed to the world) functions as an arcane pocket with 20 extra pounds.

This ability counts as having the Profession skill for qualification purposes. 4 - Power Thief When you successfully hit a DD creature, you may use your Cunning Action to cast Dispel Magic on them, targeting a \\[buff] spell they have on themselves.

Their signature ability, shadow clone, makes them able to exist in many places at once, vastly increasing their ability to gather information. Not historically accurate, but its more fun this way C: 1 - Shadow Clone (Su) \\[companion] You can spend a standard action to cause an exact copy of yourself to appear in an adjacent space. A brief cloud of smoke appears to obscure who the real one is (flip a coin to see if you target the one you intend to). If you are hiding when you do this, so is the clone. In most aspects, the creature functions exactly as you do with respect to things like attack, damage, saving throws etc. Whenever they expend a resource, such as mana, a consumable item, or ammunition, it gets expended for you as well, including contributing to the cap on techniques used per turn. The clone gets all of its own actions, it reasons just as well as you do and follows your direct orders, but you have no supernatural ability to communicate with it over long distances. The clone automatically disappears when it fails a saving throw against anything or takes any damage. When the clone dies, or you dismiss it, you instantly gain all of its memories back, as though you had experienced the events yourself. There is no range limit on how far the clone can get from you. If a creature has reason to suspect you aren't the real you, they roll perception vs your class DC or 10+your disguise bonus, whichever is higher. You can have a maximum of 1 shadow clone out at once. When you make a shadow clone, you are still the \"real you\" and the clone is still a fake.&#x20; Remembering your clone's experiences can be traumatic. If one is killed, roll a DC 9 luck check. On a fail, gain an affliction. You (or the clone itself on mission complete) can cause a clone to safely disappear as a free action. {% hint style=\"warning\" %} This ability is incredibly versatile and has the ability to completely warp the game. I'm sure there are plenty of ways to exploit this ability, but the DM should not be afraid to not let certain things work. For instance, if you share the same resources and then a clone sits in a nearby safe place to spam some kind of mana restoration effect. This is clearly against the spirit of the ability. Don't let it happen. {% endhint %} 2 - Light Steps (Su) \\[concentration] You can start concentrating on this ability as a free action.\\ As long as you only move during your turn and take no other action, you can walk along any flat continuous surface. This can include things that aren't even otherwise solid such as water or lava. It can also include things such as walls or ceilings. You can use this ability for only part of your turn to get to a location, but if you attack, cast a spell etc, then you need be on a surface you would normally be able to stand on or you plummet. 2 - Fade Away (Su) While you stand completely still and take no action on your turn, you are affected as per invisibility until you do. This can also happen if you are unable to move or take actions, such as when stunned. 4 - Bothersome Buddies (Su) You can spend 2 mana as a swift action to use shadow clone to instantly create 3 clones, but they do not leave your space or scar you on death. This functions as mirror image. 4 - Smoke Bomb (Su) By spending 2 mana and your cunning action, you can create a cloud of dense smoke in a 10 ft radius around you and hide. It typically only lasts a 3 rounds, but can last 1 in windy environs or it doesn't work at all during storms. Other types of \\[air] effects can cause it to disperse more quickly as well. 6 - Substitution (Su) \\[recharge] \\[teleportation] By spending 3 mana as an immediate action, you can cause an unattended object within 30 ft of you to be the target of your attack instead of you, such as a log, furniture etc. You take the place of the object you used and you immediately vanish until the end of your next turn. 11 - Eyes Everywhere Shadow Clone gains the \\[scrying] tag, allowing you to witness what they see while concentrating.",

This usually only allows you to attend to things in your nearby area, such as in your city. When you succeed on serendipity, you happen to wake up to use the bathroom, you do a late night milk run or you got a tip in advance. Typically the DC is 10, with circumstances such as distance, specificity, what you are doing when the event happens and how accessible what you chose to keep your eye on can increase the DC, with unfavorable circumstances adding +2, and downright ridiculous ones (like being in a prison after visiting hours) adding +4, up to a maximum of DC 20. Certain physical limitations, such as being unable to keep tabs on something a country away, can make using this ability impossible. You can keep tabs on (1+luck) things at a time. 2 - Kip Up As a free action, end the knockdown condition. 2 - Quick Study \\[recharge] By spending 1 hour doing research or practicing, you can become proficient in a particular skill for the rest of the day. Certain skills may require facilities or equipment in order to properly practice (such as a library for knowledge skills, or thieves tools for sleight of hand). 4 - Black Market Connections You can sell any item, no questions asked, so long as you are in a place you could consider a city. While inside of a city, you can also spend a few hours to figure out the kinds of illegal things that people sell there such as things related to forbidden magic, or human trafficking, and where you can purchase said items. You have enough street cred to trade with such vendors without requiring any checks. If you unearth this operation, such as by telling proper authorities or the public, you lose this street cred. This also happens if an ally you bring does so.&#x20; Whenever you sell an item, you get 60% of the items value instead of 50% by default. 4 - Fortune Filch You can spend a daily use of stroke of luck to cause an unattended, loose handheld object within 60 ft to instantly end up in your hands. The way this happens is usually very dramatic and unlikely, changing based on the scenario. A plank in the floor goes loose, catapulting a key towards you when someone steps nearby. A leak springs in your ship next to you, causing the item to spill out. You never need to roll to achieve the desired result.",

If the creature has only attempted to move, and it falls over, then it may swap equipment to change strategies even though it isn't the start of its turn.

By day you live your life as you’ve always lived it. By night, you live as an alternate persona with the power to enact change in the world. 1 - Secret Identity You have an alternate identity, with its own name and specific appearance. A secret identity usually has a very unusual outfit, and it always covers the face. Changing between your normal and secret identity requires 3 rounds and some privacy, lest the secret is revealed. Only a handful of trusted individuals are privy to the vigilantes true identity. When using your secret identity, you change your mannerisms, voice, clothes and even more dramatic things about your appearance, making you unrecognizable to even your closest friends. Even magic cannot distinguish the two. For example if you are asked about information only told to your true identity, truth detecting magic cannot tell the user of any lies about what you know. Magical attempts to locate your secret identity fail if you are in your true identity etc. If you are defeated or otherwise incapacitated and a creature takes a FRA to reveal you while in your secret identity, they can discover your true identity. Creatures that know your true identity ignore your resistance to magical and nonmagical detection by swapping identities. 1 - Secret Lair For vigilantes that stick in one place, they can spend 1 week to locate/create a location secluded from the surrounding area. Located in sewers, caves, abandoned buildings and the like, the secret lair is a safe location. Any mundane attempts to find the lair must beat a DC (25+lvl) check to locate it. Such attempts usually cannot be made without some kind of hint, such as chasing you as you return to it. Magic to locate the lair, or anybody inside, automatically fails. The lair can be quite spacious, large enough to fit training areas, holding cells for your enemies and vaults for your valuables. There are several methods of reaching your lair from different locations. If needed, you can empty your secret lair within a day. 1 - Signature Vehicle You have connections with a talented engineer that can fashion you a unique vehicle. This vehicle is very sturdy and large enough to comfortably hold 6 medium creatures, in addition to you. You get access to 3 different mobility upgrades from the pilot archetype of mechanic. If the vehicle is targeted with any attacks or harmful effects then use your saves, AC, etc to figure out what happens. The vehicle is treated as an object to determine how it is affected by harmful effects. It has half your hp. If it falls to 0, it is inoperable. 1 - The Signal You have a 6th sense for specific sights and sounds that indicate people require your assistance such as a symbol displayed in the clouds from a light, or a type of whistle. You can sense these automatically when they happen within a mile of you, and you know its exact position. 1/day when such a signal occurs, you can change into your secret identity and travel to where the signal happened from within 1 minute.",

It functions exactly as you, expending your resources such as mana, limited uses per day items and abilities, consumable items etc. TLDR; This ability does not generate more resources. Your copy is a minion version of you (making it 1/3 your level). It is 1 size category smaller than you and uses the hp you sacrificed as its max hp.

As a swift action, consume one to gain a series of ANY benefits from the polymorph list. Each of these qualities has a point value associated with them. You have (3+lvl) points to choose abilities with. These points are often used through other features and are referred to as adaptation points. The effects last an hour and are permanent @6. All benefits are replaced the next time you use it. While under the effects of a \\[poly, baleful] effect, you can use shapeshift to immediately end it and still benefit from shapeshift as normal. See subsection for all abilities. You have access to all the charts, unless it shares the name with an archetype. 1 - Shifter Claws You possess claws on your hands that you can sheathe and unsheathe. This natural attack deals 2d6 slashing damage while your hands are empty, or d10 if they are not. Typically while shapeshifted (using the true polymorph version) you can't wield weapons, shields etc so the damage is always 2d6. Any other natural attacks that you gain through this class shares this damage, but often with a different damage type. These claws persist through shapeshift, transforming into another form of attack if the creature doesn't have a similar pair of limbs to adapt to (rhino, lion). Your claws share the properties of a single weapon in your position, such as magic enchantment, a magic focuses ability to cast spells, or special attacks.

You can essentially write secret messages by touching your finger to any natural object (typically boulders and trees) and writing. Any message written in this way can be erased by a creature that knows druidic with ease. 2 - Beast Speech (Su) You can speak with beasts as though you shared a common language. They are able to much better articulate their feelings as though they possessed the intellect of a simple humanoid, but their instincts, desires and attitude toward you remain largely the same. 3 - Beast Companion You gain the service of a specific animal to aid you on your journey. It grows more powerful as you do. More rules on beast companions in the beast companion section of beast trainer.

When used against a creature, you learn whether the creature is interested in taking advantage of you, interested in helping you, or not particularly interested in you. You don't learn about their plans, only their relation to you. If the creature is a beast, you also learn if it is polymorphed. When you use it on a terrain, its mostly focused on your immediate vicinity or a place you plan to go, such as a cave mouth or the front gate of a town.

Whenever a creature you can see is at or below an hp total equal to (9+lvl), you know. When a creature within 30 feet is at this threshold, you can spend an immediate action to dash with incredible speeds to reach it (in a straight line, even if it is airborne \\[if you can't fly you fall]) and make an unarmed strike against it. On hit it instantly defeats the creature and you heal (3+lvl) hp. If you so choose, though is completely unnecessary, you can brutally and spectacularly execute whatever creature you just targeted with this ability and they die...Horribly (fort negates). Killing a creature in such a way always results in some amazing feat of strength, agility and a disturbing creativity in the Slayer’s brutality. If this threshold happens to be larger than the health pool possessed by the creature, the Slayer can still use this ability even though they have taken no damage, though he does not heal or regain Argent Energy off of them. 1 - Energy: Old Friend Using this energy, you can manifest a powerful double barrel shotgun with a creative attachment. Manifesting the gun is the same as the \"swapping gear\" action. Merely holding the gun does not require energy, but each shot requires 1 energy.

If you target a creature, you must make a ranged attack, but when you arrive adjacent to it, you can fire the shotgun or make an unarmed strike against the creature. Meat hook does not require energy. 1 - Energy: Shredder This ability functions as Old Friend, but instead of a shotgun you manifest an axe guitar with the following stats…\\ DMG - 2d8 S\\ Properties - 2h\\ Shred - Gain proficiency in performance, but only in playing guitar. +4 when using the shredder.\\ Riff of Rage - Give all allies within 60 ft +2 attack for 1 round (standard action)\\ Special Attack: Finale - Declare an attack as a finale. If the attack ends the combat, future finale attacks gain +1 damage permanently. If it does not end the combat, lose 1 damage (minimum 0). A savvy foe can tell how many stacks you have. {% hint style=\"danger\" %} Finale only stacks in actual combat, not training. You can never passively gain stacks. {% endhint %} 1 - Energy: Dash \\[elusive] As a free action, move 10 feet, even directly into the air. Can be used multiple times to cover great distances. 2 - Energy: Blood Punch Augment an unarmed strike that staggers the creature on hit (fort negates). If the attack is successful, enemies within 10 feet of the original target automatically take the attacks damage. This ability can be used in tandem with techniques. 3 - Energy: Heavy Assault This ability functions as Old Friend, but instead of a shotgun you manifest a rifle with the following stats…\\ DMG - 2d8 P\\ Properties - 2h\\ Range - 30 ft (no second increment)\\ Zoom - As a FRA, make a single shot with 100 ft range and +2 attack. 3 - Heavy Impact When you fall at least 20 ft, you release a shockwave in a 10 ft radius around you. If you fell at least 50 ft, the shockwave is a 20 ft radius. The effect this has depends on the target and their HP threshold. Against enemy minions, it sets them to your glory kill threshold. If they are already within the glory kill threshold, they are defeated. Against anything else (including allies), it deals 10 poise damage. 4 - Energy: Grenade As a free action during movement, spend 2 energy to throw a supercharged ball of energy that explodes on impact on the ground, affecting all creatures within 10 ft of the space it lands in. You have 3 types of grenades\\ \\[Fire] - Set creatures ablaze (reflex negates).\\ Frag - Deal (3d6+lvl) crush damage and poise damage. If this breaks poise, the creature is knocked down (reflex halves damage).\\ \\[Frost] - Put creatures in stasis for 1 round (reflex reduces to frosty for 1 round). 5 - Energy: Hammer This ability functions as Old Friend, but instead of a shotgun you manifest a hammer with the following stats…\\ DMG - 2d8 C\\ Properties - 2h, CM (Sunder)\\ Horny Jail - As a standard action, automatically bonk a creature within reach to make them not horny for 1 hour.\\ Hammer Down \\[recharge] - 1/combat, strike the ground as a standard action to deal your (d6+d6/odd level) crush dmg and make creatures clumsy 2 within 20 ft (fort halves dmg).\\ Plunging Attack - If you start your turn above a creature and are not flying/pseudo-flying, you can make a plunging attack. Plunging attack adds 1 damage per 10 feet you fall (max +20 dmg). Plunging attack can also apply to Hammer Down. 6 - Striking Weapon attacks gain additional damage equal to their damage dice. Gain this again at level 10\\ Examples: \\ 2h weapon @1=2d6, @6=4d6, @11=6d6\\ Light Weapon @1=d6, @6=2d6, @11=3d6 7 - Energy: Ballista This ability functions as Old Friend, but instead of a shotgun you manifest a hand held ballista with the following stats…\\ DMG - 2d8 P\\ Properties - 2h, Siege Weapon\\ Range - 60 ft (no second increment)\\ Special Attack: GET OVER HERE! - On hit make a drag attack with a +4 bonus. If successful they are pulled adjacent to you\\ Siege Mode \\[recharge] - 1/combat as a FRA charge and release a horizontal slashing energy projectile. Creatures in a 100ft line that is 15 ft wide take (5d8+lvl) slashing damage and start bleeding for 2d8 damage (reflex halves damage and negates bleed).\\ You can reduce the charge time, making this only require a standard action, but the line is only 5 ft wide. 9 - Energy: Sword This ability functions as Old Friend, but instead of a shotgun you manifest a sword with the following stats…\\ DMG - 2d8 S\\ Properties - 2h, Special Attack: Determination\\ Melt - As a standard action, cut a hole in a surface of solid or lesser toughness large enough for you to fit through with ease.\\ Special Attack: Sever - On hit sever an limb from a creature (fort negates).\\ Arm - Creature is unable to use arm\\ Leg - Creatures speed is reduced by 15. Clumsy 1 permanently.\\ Wing - Creature is unable to fly. Other limbs can be selected, disabling natural attacks like tentacles and such. These are just the most common examples. 10 - Carnage You gain combat reflexes as a bonus feat.

Instead you regain 2 energy when you successfully parry an attack. 1 - Sawblade Shield You start play with and can craft a circular shield with spinning blades inside of it with 8 hours of work and 100g. This is treated as a tower shield and a 1h weapon that can deal slash or crush damage and has the CM (shove) and CM (bully) properties. If this shield is sundered or destroyed, it repairs itself after 1 round.&#x20; In the hands of a Sentinel, the shield also additional properties. It has the thrown property and 2 enchantment slots, one of which is the returning enchantment, but the returning can be used as an instant action. You can reasonably augment existing shields to also make them better suit your tastes, giving them the above properties. 1 - Omniparry Any offensive ability that deals damage to you, you can parry. Roll an attack roll as an immediate action. Against opposing attack rolls, if you match their roll, you negate it. Against anything else if you match the DC of the ability, you negate it entirely (at least for you in the case of AoE effects). When you successfully parry any ability, you rupture your attacker and any other enemies within 10 ft of them, making them clumsy 2 and setting them to 1 poise. {% hint style=\"danger\" %} But how do I determine my attack bonus for parrying? You use what your melee attack bonus would be against the target. If you are currently flanking the target, add flanking. If your shield has the bane enchantment against their creature type, add bane. {% endhint %} 1 - Energy: Onslaught \\[elusive] As a free action, spend 2 energy to dash directly adjacent to a creature within 30 ft and crash into them, releasing a powerful shockwave. The target creature and all enemies within 10 ft are staggered (fort negates). Instead of a shockwave, you can instead choose to shove the target. 1 - Sawed Off When you make a thrown attack with your shield, it embeds itself into a creature on hit, entangling them. If at the end of the creatures turn it is still entangled by this, it takes your shield attack damage again. If you choose to use the returning property of your shield to parry, shield action etc, this entangle ends. When a creature is a minion, you know. You do not need to make attack rolls with your shield against minions. They are automatically crit by your shield attacks. If you defeat a minion with a shield attack, it can bounce to another minion within 20 ft. 1 - Feats You gain the shield focus, sentinel and point blank master feats. 2 - Shield Runes (Su) Inscribe a rune upon your shield to give it additional powers that activate when you successfully parry. You can only activate 1 rune when you parry.\\ Choose one at this level and another at level 6 and 10, Quaking Rune - All ruptured creatures are also staggered.\\ Vengeful Rune - Your next onslaught against a ruptured creature costs no energy. If you are within range, you can use onslaught as an instant action.\\ Celestial Rune - All ruptured creatures are smited by divine power, taking 2d6+lvl (7+lvl) holy damage.\\ Cursed Rune - All ruptured creatures gain weakness 2 to all damage. \\ Ligma Rune - All ruptured creatures contract ligma.",

A unique source means something that is different from the previous ones. For example, your two financial wizard brothers would not be different sources. Those same two brothers and a dragon are 2 sources. 2 brothers, a dragon and a laboratory are 3 sources. Basically there needs to be a variety of sources of inspiration for arcane synergy to function. Each individual can still lend aid, giving a bonus depending on their proficiency. In that same example, your two brothers would collectively give a +6 bonus (2 proficient+2 proficient+2 synergy). The dragon, less versed in magic, lacks the arcana skill and gives a +3 bonus. The lab you are doing research in normally gives +2, but with synergy gives +4. So your bonus changes from +7 to +13 thanks to arcane synergy with this setup.",

Each one a prodigy in their own right, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with mana.

Characters with magical specialization gain points in wild card equal to their highest tier of magic technique and cantrips. 1 - Cutting Edge Choose a magical technique tree. This tree is the field of magic you specialize in. You get a +8 bonus to arcana when dealing with spells of this school. You gain a technique point in this tree, and an additional technique point each odd level, all must be dedicated to this specific technique tree. Every time you gain a technique point in this tree, you can make some magic happen. You can choose one of 3 paths, depending on how much effort you are willing to put forth... 1. You can create your own completely original spell for this spell school. This can be a bit of a daunting task, requiring a degree of trust between game master and player. Once a spell is created, the balancing does not stop there, and should be adjusted as needed to not disrupt the game too much. 2. Alter an existing spell. Have you ever looked at a spell and wished it was just a little bit different? Perhaps you wanted a boneless boneshaker spell, or a snow woman instead of a snow man. These changes are encouraged to alter not only the flavor text, but also the mechanics. Perhaps our boneless-shaker allows you to create the boneless world you desire, tearing out a creatures skeleton leaving them a clumsy blob person. Perhaps a snow woman is more affectionate preferring to get up close and personal, grabbing creatures and keeping them frosty.\\ In any case, the power of the altered spell should be pretty close to the original, and should serve a similar type of purpose.\\ You could also choose to upgrade a lower level spell. Say you thought fireblast wasn't explosive enough. Make a 5th level version that explodes again at the end of your next turn, forcing creatures who failed the initial save to eat another one without some extra speed or aid from allies. 3. If you aren't confident in your ability, or just don't have the time. Gain +1 memory. 1 - Skill You are proficient in the arcana skill with a +4 bonus. 1 - Neuroplasticity You can choose to leave up to 3 of your memory slots unused. By spending 1 minute, you can choose to prepare a spell in that unused memory slot. If you \\[mana burn] 1, you can fill an empty slot as a free action. 1 - Familiar Choose a level 0 fiend, celestial or fey, or create a beast that is automatically tiny using the Beast Trainer's Beast Companion feature. It's level is always 0. If it aids you in combat, it gains the \\[companion] tag. You can also use your familiar to do a handful of other useful things. Spying \\[scrying] - You can sense through your companion at will. See the scrying tag for more details.\\ Assistant - Your companion can use the aid action to assist you for any skill checks.\\ To My Side \\[teleportation] - You can concentrate for 3 rounds to teleport your companion to your side. 2 - Mana Wells Your mana pool is deeper than most. Add 1 to your mana pool at this level, and levels 4, 6, 8 and 10. 2 - Arcane Discovery The remainder of this class is full of arcane discoveries. These features are customizable abilities that you gain at level 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Each archetype comes with its own.",

You and up to five creatures can stay at a denizen's house. You are fed and given basic supplies. They are even willing to protect you should danger come knocking, but not risk their lives. Using this feature for many days in a short time frame in the same settlement makes the settlement incompatible with this ability. Certain monstrous or dangerous creatures may be off limits (such as giant carnivorous beast companions) without some convincing.In general you are an ally to the common folk and you will be privy to usually hidden information such as rising civil unrest, local crime usually kept quite through intimidation or secret passageways.Noble Steed (Su)1/day you can conjure 6 shiny golden spectral horses. The horses have a speed of 60 and our intelligent enough to follow complex instructions given by the zealot. The horses last until you rest. These steeds can be mounted or dismounted as a free action 1/turn. They otherwise function as the horse bestiary entry, save for they cannot stampede or attack.Judgement (Su)As an immediate action when a creature makes a statement (I did not kill the child, the food isn’t poisoned, my name is Bob), you can dispense judgment. You shout and your eyes glow as you point at them dramatically. The creature rolls a will save. If they pass nothing happens. If they fail, the truthfulness of their statement is revealed. They glow golden for a few seconds if the statement is truthful, they glow red if they are withholding pertinent information and they glow dark purple if they speak an outright lie. If the creature glows gold, this ability goes on a 10 minute cooldown. Otherwise it is put on a 1 minute cooldown.Commander (Su)As a free action you can decide to increase the distance your voice carries. Your voice can be easily heard as though you were shouting nearby from a distance of 500 feet. Once per hour you can cause your voice to be heard 10 miles away for up to 1 minute. Creatures can tell the general direction your voice comes from with this ability.Overuse of this ability will draw the ire of local citizens or creatures.Vigilance (Su)When you perform a task that could be reasonably considered “keeping watch” such as at night on the road or as a guard to a party, you gain a +5 sacred bonus to perception and +1 priority if you spot an ambush.You do not need to sleep in order to gain the benefits of rest, but the activities you do cannot be intense (reading, patrol, etc.).Sacred Vow (Su)You can bind creatures to their word. As part of a one minute ritual you can make a request to a willing creature (no killing people, no eating pizza, you must return home). The creature must verbally agree (or the creature’s equivalent like telepathy) for the sacred vow to take hold. You can set additional parameters (you must return home by x day, on foot, go through the trench not over it) as needed for the request to function. The creature who accepted the vow is now bound by their word. If they take an action that is in direct violation of their vow, they must roll a will save or be unable to perform it for 24 hours. The zealot is aware of when the creature takes such an action, and whether they pass or fail the save against this effect, as well as some psychic impressions on the details (they decided to take a vacation on the way home, interrupted by bandits, death by snu snu). They are immediately able to use sending to express their disappointment.This vow can only be removed by the zealot.Under Arrest (Su)You can use your authority to make keeping an enemy alive as prisoner much easier. With a one minute ritual requiring physical contact, you can give a creature the time out condition for 24 hours. A mark appears on the creature akin to a timepiece to indicate roughly how long is left before the effect wears off. You cannot use this ability on the same creature again for one week.Halo (Su)You gain a glowing halo. This can vary in appearance based on your patron deity. In any case, it shows your unquestionable loyalty towards upholding good and honorable behavior. You are unable to roll deception to lie to creatures. In return, you will never be accused of committing crimes without direct clear involvement, looked upon with suspicion by law enforcement and will always be treated with respect by authority. Your words carry a great weight in matters concerning diplomacy, extermination of evil. and public safety, allowing you audience with powerful leaders such as commanders, kings and such with ease.Protect the Innocent (Su)When an enemy decides to attack or use a harmful ability (defined as something the creature wants to resist) on an ally that is unconscious, a noncombatant, hostage or something similar while they can see the zealot (or sense the zealot if the creature is like a slug or something), they must roll a will save or be taunted by the zealot for 1 minute. During this minute, the \"innocent\" is immune to damage/being moved by this creature.The basic idea is it will interrupt their turn before they already used their actions/movement, so try to be lenient so that way the zealot can get the pain they’re due for protecting innocents. DMs may want to consider having mercy on the zealot in something like a warzone, limiting this ability to only affect the immediate area.",

It bounces to an additional target at level 6 and 10. Functions even if the attack is melee.\\ Each additional target needs to be within 20 ft of the last.

      "content": "🎭 Maligner Maligners are master manipulators that worm their way into positions of power through deceit and cunning. They use enchantments to force cooperation, illusions to misdirect, lies to spread rumors, and polymorphs to imitate. While there are Maligners that start off benevolent, they most often find themselves engaging in morally abhorrent behavior while impersonating enemies just to keep their stories straight. {% hint style=\"info\" %} This class is a pretty odd fit for this game, mostly because it has basically zero combat related abilities as part of the class. The role a Maligner will play in a party will probably be akin to that of a rogue. They are much more impressive out of combat than in combat.&#x20; {% endhint %} {% tabs %} {% tab title=\"Art\" %} Maestra, Mask Merchant, Hearthstone {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Basic Stats\" %} | HP (specialist) | 20(+6 per level) | | --------------- | ---------------- | | Poise | 5 | | Skills | 4 | | Save | Will | | Memory | 2+(2\\*lvl) | {% endtab %} {% endtabs %} 1 - Technique Specialization (Magic) You gain 3 technique points at level 1, then another 2 points every 2 levels after.\\ These technique points can be used on the Shira, Moogen and one other tree, chosen at character creation. Characters with magical specialization gain points in wild card equal to their highest tier of magic technique and cantrips. 1 - Faceless Monster (Su) \\[polymorph, true] \\[companion] As a standard action, you can assume an alternate persona of your creation.\\ You fabricate a backstory, connections, race, appearance, clothes, voice, the works - this alternate form is completely unique. When you have an alternate persona, you have no \"true\" form. Your alternate persona has all of your abilities and statistics, but you can decide to swap up to 2 of your skills for any others, and your race may be different. If these changes cause you to no longer qualify for a feat or class feature upon assuming the other form, then you lose access as normal. It takes a week of work to fabricate a new form, and a week to \"kill off\" an old form. These personas consume your Companion slots, and you may have more than one if you have enough slots. You start off with one alternate persona. 1 - Skill Gain deception and disguise as bonus skills. 1 - Catechize \\[language] Upon engaging in conversation with a creature for at least one minute, you can call out one detail of its appearance, recent activities (within a day), or mannerisms as a free action. You instantly learn its mental state and intentions as they relate to the detail, within the scope of the totality of information you have on the creature (will negates). Essentially, you correctly guess why a creature did or is doing something. Part of this ability is speaking your guess to the creature, and judging your accuracy off of its response; if it passes its save, you guess wrong, may look silly, and can no longer use this ability on the same creature until you rest. &#x20;You may substitute the DC with Insight, and the target may substitute its Will save with Deception. 2 - Rumor Trails (Su) \\[concentration] As a free action, name a rumor. You gain a sixth sense for who has heard or spread this rumor. If you see the people they told or heard it from, they appear to glow white or red to you, respectively. If you interact with the creature, you can see a literal trail of ethereal energy to the people they either heard the rumor from, or who they told the rumor. Using this ability again negates the previous use. 4 - Face Stealer (Su) \\[poly, true] You can amputate a helpless, willing, or recently deceased (within an hour) playable race's face, and spend 500g and 8 hours of labor to convert it into a Maligner's Mask attuned to that specific creature. Most creatures will die or go blind upon having their face amputated without immediate medical attention. When you wear this mask, you partially transform into that creature, which counts as a disguise and grants a +4 bonus skill checks to appear as that specific creature. Putting it on is a full round action, but removing it is a Swapping Gear action. It does not change your clothes or equipment. Other creatures may wear these masks. While you possess a mask, you can use Faceless Monster to create a persona of a person whose mask you possess. If the persona you steal still lives, or is absent for long periods of time, it can cause problems. 6 - Rumormonger You can attempt to spread a rumor throughout a small town or larger settlement by attempting a deception check. The difficulty depends on the size, ranging from 10 for a small town to 30 for a metropolis, though this difficulty may be modified if the population as a whole tends towards skepticism or insanity. It takes a week for a rumor to spread. If you succeed by 5 or more, the time is reduced to 3 days. If you fail by 5 or more, the rumor mutates into a competing theory. Each of your personas may only have one rumor brewing at a time. 8 - All Friends Here (Su) After a minute of concentration, you can enter a state of calm where you deepen your connection with your collection of masks. You can communicate with the fragments of the persons soul left behind within. The masks appear to speak to you, and you can inquire things about these people as though you were a neutral party. As such, they are usually willing to tell you some things, but hesitant for others, usually requiring skill checks. Once you try and pry into something secret and fail, the information is lost forever.&#x20; The masks are unable to form new memories, and therefore always treat you as they would a stranger, no matter what you ask.",

Characters with martial specialization gain points in warfare equal to their highest tier of martial technique. 1 - Mana Wells You have a mana pool vaster than even that of most practiced mages. You gain an additional point of mana this level and every even level after. All your points of mana reserves are instead converted into maximum mana, unless they are tied to specific items. 1 - Mana Barrier \\[healing] \\[force] You can manifest a shimmering barrier of volatile energy that protects you and snaps at those who disturb it. As a standard action, you can grant yourself temp hp equal to your current mana. Keep note of this value. Whenever a creature deals HP damage to you, they also take this value as force damage, regardless of how much of the temp hp you actually have left. Mana barrier lasts indefinitely. Anything that decreases the temp hp you gain when you initially use this ability, like bone chill, also reduces the counterattack damage. 1 - Manamateurs \\[upcast] Whenever you take damage, you can spend mana as an immediate action to reduce the damage. You can spend 1 mana to reduce the damage of an effect on you by 3. If you decrease the damage of an effect to zero, it still activates the force damage counterattack from Mana Barrier. Upcast - For each additional mana spent, reduce the damage you take from an effect by 3. 1 - Innate Casting You can innately cast the Mana Ramping cantrip. 1 - Taste the Mana Whenever you inflict mana burn, you restore 1 mana. You can also use the mana burn you inflict on another creature to cure your own, but you are drained 1 for every 2 mana burn you cure.

This functions as the Tongue Twister technique with a few key differences: You can only use this as an immediate action to a creature casting a spell. If the creature fails its save, it only suffers the effects of tongue twister for the spell it is casting. If it has already spent any actions that tongue twister would normally consume, they are instead staggered until the end of their next turn. 2 - Mania While at or above half mana, you have a +10 bonus to your speed, advantage on perception checks and immunity to fatigue. 2 - Depression While below half mana, but not out of mana, you gain the following special attack usable an unlimited number of times per combat.\\ Special Attack: Mana Leech - On hit, steal (½ lvl) mana from the target. If the creature does not prepare techniques, also expend the use of a random 1/day innate technique they have. When you are completely out of mana, you become fatigued, but you gain resistance to damage that originates from an effect than can be dispelled (ie Su/Sp effects). You recover 1 mana at the start of your turn. 4 - Backlash You gain Psionic Backlash as an at-will innate technique. When you use it, the creature is mana burned 2 (will halves).

If an enemy steps on a trapped space, it blossoms. Blossomed traps create an area of brightly lit difficult terrain in a 5 ft radius around its space until the end of the triggering creatures turn. At the end of the turn of the triggering creature, it explodes, dealing (2d6+d6/odd lvl) pierce damage to the area made into difficult terrain. You can have 2 traps out at once at any given time. If you place another while 2 are out, one of your choosing disappears. You are mentally alerted when a trap is triggered, and which one. You gain +4 perception against any creature that has triggered a trap since you last rested. Whenever you defeat a creature, it automatically triggers a flowering trap beneath them that explodes at the start of your next turn. 1 - Spotlight (Su) \\[light] By spending 1 mana as swift action, you can target a creature within 60 ft to have a spotlight focus on for 1 minute. The light around the spotlight artificially dims for dramatic effect (but no mechanical effect). That creature takes a -10 penalty on stealth and is brightly illuminated. The creature also has advantage on perform checks. While a spotlight is active, you can increase the volume of your voice to echo over even large crowds. 1 - Behind the Mask (Su) You have an alternate ego that forms while masked, with its own name. Magical means to detect things treat you as two different creatures (such as red hand of the killer). If a creature takes off your mask, you can spend 1 mana as an instant action to cause the mask they remove to be a temporary copy that lasts 1 minute, revealing another mask underneath. +2 to disguise while masked. While your face is obscured, such as with a mask or in darkness, you can make your voice sound like anyone you have heard. 1 - Finale You gain a unique special attack.\\ Finale - Deal an additional 1 damage with a pistol attack. If this ends the combat, permanently increase the damage of finale by 1. If it does not end the combat, decrease the damage of finale by 1 (minimum 1). You cannot stack finale in mock combats, training, or passively during down time hunting wolves etc. 2 - Deadly Flourish (Su) By spending 2 mana as swift action, you can target a 60 ft line. The very first enemy within this line is entangled for 1 round (reflex negates). If a flowering trap you can see is triggered, you can activate this as an immediate action against a creature within the radius of the blossoming trap. 2 - The Crowd Goes Wild!

You can cause it to form a pool of a specific shape, with enough precision to write in text, but usually no more than 2 sentences. You can also cause it to make patterns on the deceased's skin. 4 - Curtains Close (Su) When you defeat a creature, you can spend 2 mana as an instant action to cause a pair of curtains to appear and close in between you and your victim directly adjacent to you. These curtains are 20 ft tall and 20 ft wide. It lasts for 1 minute, or until they are opened. You can open the curtains as a free action from any distance, and an enemy can open the curtains as a standard action if they are adjacent. It is not difficult for any creature to simply move past the curtains by going through or under without opening them. 5 - Eulogy (Su) When you kill someone, you can write a eulogy for them, provided you have the means to physically write one. You can drop this eulogy off on the corpse, the creature's previous home or simply a nearby settlement. This eulogy naturally multiplies, finding itself in newspaper stands, cafes, waiting rooms etc. The less important the creature, the less it spreads. This results in the eulogy being pretty common knowledge for well known people, and the talk of the town for beloved or reviled creatures. You can choose to write or draw anything on this eulogy, but cannot attach any kind of magical spells/traps to it. It must be concise enough to fit on a single standard page. 6 - Red Carpet (Su) By spending 1 mana as a free action, you can roll out the red carpet for 1 minute. This carpet is 10 ft wide and 60 ft long. It must be placed on a mostly flat, though not necessarily solid, surface. It can also be placed on any surface where carpet is commonly found (such as a staircase). It can be placed on the surface of still(ish) water. It can be used as a bridge to cross a chasm, provided the gap is mostly level. While walking on this carpet, creatures ignore difficult terrain. If you make another carpet, the previous one disappears. 7 - Theater of the Mind (Su) \\[mind-affecting] You can extend your hand towards a creature and offer to show them the world (or something to that effect). If they willingly take your hand, they are automatically fascinated for up to 5 minutes. During this time you completely obscure their senses from the outside world and take them on a magical journey of your imagining with catchy songs and pretty visuals straight out of a Disney movie. To the outside world it merely looks like you are holding hands with the creature. You can even decide to move the creature around as though you were going for a walk, or dancing at a party. If you move more than 60 ft away from the creatures location, then the fascination ends. 8 - Bouncing Grenade By spending 2 mana as a swift action, drop a peculiar grenade on a creature within 30 ft of you that deals 4d6 (14) crush damage to it and then bounces up to 10 ft to a target of your choosing, dealing this damage again. \\ If it defeats the enemy, you can choose another creature within 30 ft for it to bounce to and its damage increases by 2d6 (7).\\ The grenade can hit a maximum of 4 creatures. 9 - Last Whisper When you kill a creature, you see their life flash before your eyes, learning one piece of information. * Greatest regret * Deepest secret * Closest companion 10 - Curtain Call \\[recharge] Choose a direction and reduce your speed to 0 at the start of your turn. Until you move or are poise broken you can only shoot in that direction (180 degrees), but you can increase your range to 200. Once you shoot a 4th shot, this effect ends.",

One of the more versatile classes that allows you to specialize in different types of fighting. Specialize in poisons, bombs, physical augmentations and more!Every single alchemist is completely unique thanks to their scientific discoveries.Beast Trainer (ND)The class name says it all: Form a close bond with a special animal uniquely trained to fight by your side. Beast companions can be tailored to fit very specific niches, or you can make a really big dino that chomps people. Also comes with a side of nature magic.Blood Hunter (P)A gunman with a crimson tint. You can sacrifice your life to continuously fire your firearm for massive damage. You fight to the last breath and hunt those that escape the bite of your bullets.Barbarian (C)The true bruiser class. The barbarian is designed to run straight into the middle of the battlefield all alone as their optimal strategy. They specialize in taking and dealing damage and equal measure, as well as disrupting the battlefield with combat maneuvers and raw strength, often in ridiculous ways.Bard (P)The cheerleader class. That's a bit of an exaggeration, but the bard is primarily concerned with supporting their team by inspiring them with tunes. Bards are at home in the middle of their team where they can provide the most benefit. They often excel in social situations. Their performances assure that whatever hijinks your party gets up to goes down in history.Bender (C)The elemental class. Based largely off of the \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" and \"Legend of Korra\" anime. Based off of what element you choose, you will get a variety of abilities tailored to manipulating that element. Airbenders are mobile with the ability to glide and eventually fly. Firebenders specialize in dealing damage. Earthbenders are tough to keep down and bend the element with the most utility. Water benders are the best generalists with decent durability, healing and CC.Druid (C)The nature mage class. Focus on a particular element of nature, like beasts, plants, insects or fungi. This choice informs the nature of many of your class features. The druid excels in off-road adventures to the uninhabited corners of the world.Fiend Shifter (C)The demon class. Tailor yourself towards one specific type of fiend as they are depicted in folklore and popular media. Demons primarily deal in destruction, and grow to monstrous sizes with extra demon parts to get the job done. Devils primarily deal in deals, using the power of persuasion to lock people into promises as well as lock them in place. There are more, but I'll leave it at that for brevity.Fighter (C)Do they even really need a description? Your standard warrior class whose primary asset is their mastery over their equipment. Archetypes give variety in your game plan whether its zone control with Dark Knight, dueling with Swashbuckler or horde slaying with Aran.Hero (P)A class based off of the sillyness encountered in the Oldschool Runescape MMORPG. It is very flexible, with an emphasis on adding tons of new abilities that interact with skills, similar to the signature skill feat.Healer (P)The true support class. Provides the invaluable resource of healing, whether it means hitpoints, poisons or whatever other strange ailments that befall adventures.Jester (P)Bard felt too general for me, so they're primarily musicians now. Jesters are kind of an inbetween for bard and rogue. Part martial, part mage, with tons of supernatural abilities that allow them to get into and out of trouble based on acting, prestidigitation style magic and miming.Lunatic (C)The wild magic class. A full blown magic caster class similar to 5e's wild magic sorcerer. This class is meant to be a complete joke as far as flavor text goes. If you want your character to be completely unpredictable and completely insane, this is the one for you. Praise Frogg!Light Guardian (P)Light guardians are duty-bound to protect the world from the seemingly endless onslaught of fiends and mages who would take advantage of others. A very simple martial support class centered around preventing and protecting against magic.Martial Artist (C)The unarmed class. Your primary asset is your body and your spirit. Martial artists require no equipment in order to be functional, replacing weapons and armor with years of rigorous training. This class covers everything from monks to wrestlers.Magus (ND)The spell sword class. Not quite fighter not, quite wizard, the magus specializes in dealing damage with magic via their weapons. They get unique abilities that allow them to combine spells and attacks.Maligner (C)A class with a very specific theme. You no longer exist. Instead you are a set of interchangeable and replaceable personas. There is no \"real you.\" Most of the maligner's abilities are centered around deceit through illusions, enchantments and transformations.Mechanic (ND) The mecha class. Has 2 variants: pilot and suitor. Pilots are the mecha classic where you hop into an oversized robot and use that for fighting, transportation etc. Suitors prefer a technologically advanced body suit (a la metroid) that enhances their combat prowess and comes with all kinds of useful adaptations and gadgets.Mesmerist (C)The hypnotist class. You have a very special pair of eyes that allow you to break the mental barriers of creatures just by staring at them. You cast spells that manipulate the minds of others and have a special set of psychic implants that you can use to create contingent effects like seeing through another creature's eyes or turning them into a sleeper cell.Necromancer (C)The undead master class. Every enemy that you defeat you are able to transform into an allied skeleton or zombie. Your abilities allow you to better maintain these creatures and also makes them more powerful. There are variants that are more catered towards a magic caster playstyle, and others that encourage you to get into the thick of things with your undead minions.Psychic (C)The psionic class. Your psychic powers allow you to manipulate objects with your mind, gaze into the minds of others and even manipulate their memories. There is a variant that specializes in the telekinesis, throwing objects (and creatures) around the battlefield. Another that specializes in scrying: A type of advanced magical spying technique that allows you to hear and see things from great distances. Another in reading and toying with the future.Rogue (P)The class that isn't afraid to use underhanded tactics. Rogue specialize in stealthy operations, are good with their hands and have high mobility. Rogues can be masterminds, creating nebulous plans that fall into place precisely when needed. Rogues can also be common thugs, specializing in bullying and intimidation.Shapeshifter (C)The animal transformer class. The shapeshifter has the ability to take on any number of features from different types of creatures, but mostly animals. They can choose to go an anthropomorphic hybrid mode, growing claws and jaws werewolf style, or they can choose to completely transform into animals. The wide variety of features that a shapeshifter can use and the swiftness of the transformations allows them to adapt to the situation on the fly.Summoner (???)The pokemon trainer class. The summoner summons a unique creature called an eidolon that fights by their side. As the summoner grows more powerful, they are able to shape the course of the creatures evolution, allowing them to create completely unique abominations from other realms. Outside of the eidolon, they're also able to summon other weaker creatures to supplement their main damage source.Slayer (P)The Doom class. Based largely off of the games \"Doom: 2016\" and \"Doom Eternal.\" You are a one-man army with a deadly arsenal of unique guns, melee weapons and supernatural powers almost entirely dedicated to killing things. Even without these weapons, your fists are usually enough to get the job done.Virtuoso (P)Another unique gun wielding class. Primarily based off of the league of legends character Jhin. The virtuoso has a certain flair to their combat, creating flashy displays out of their gunplay. Fear the 4th shot.Wizard (ND)The magic caster with the biggest brain. Wizards possess the unique ability to memorize their spells on the fly. Given enough time for preparation, a skilled wizard can overcome any problem, including creating entirely new spells.Zealot (C)The crusader class. Zealots are shielded by their faith in god as much as their armor. They always take the moral high ground and have mercy for other creatures. Some creatures though, like undead and demons, are beyond redemption, and must be eliminated by using their divine powers to smite them into oblivion.",

How they survived a bloody conflict, went through incredibly rigorous training to become the best and brightest mage, was chosen by god or some other equally astonishing development. Then the game says \"you die in one hit to a goblin.\" While not entirely unrealistic, it doesn't make for very satisfying gameplay to have your character feel like they are made out of paper and are one stray crit away from instant death. A game like DnD 5e remedies this by making KO'd a state your character falls in and out of multiple times as a result of \"le nat 20,\" spammable low action healing and a lack of negative hit points. If you want the player characters to be invincible compared to monsters of a similar level, I say skip the pretense. Player characters are of a different breed and are hardened by their previous adventures, granting the following benefits… HP - Your hp is increased by 10.\\ Defeat - You do not have a chance to instantly die when you fall unconscious, instead you receive a stacking debuff called doom. You also accumulate afflictions. With this change, a measure of how worn down you are can be more easily tied to how much hp you have. There are obviously other factors, but you can't ever keep adventuring without hp. Mana is the general resource system tied to using special abilities, and it naturally recharges when not used. In general healing that keeps you at full HP all the time is intended to be more scarce, and usually come at the cost of reducing your max mana until you rest. In general, only PCs will have this buff. But BBEGs, legendary creatures and other major bosses intended for use at the end of major story beats could also receive a similar version of this buff. Then you can get the juicy \"phase transition\" threshold to give your big boss encounters more punch.",

It is essential for character creation. {% endhint %} There are several things for you to decide when deciding what you're writing down on your character sheet. Start with a theme, aesthetic, fighting style, or a particular character you want to mimic from popular media. There's nothing wrong with working backwards, but in general, I listed things from most important to least important when it comes to making your character sheet and starting to play. * &#x20;You should probably start with… 1ClassThe way that I've designed classes has generally been pretty specific in terms of theme. Some classes come with archetypes (subclasses).Some classes have choices pre-built in, like what type of techniques you know, a martial artist's fighting style or a necromancer's starting minion.2RaceRaces come with a variety of benefits. Primary race features help define what role they generally fit, while secondary features are generally more interchangeable.Human is kind of the \"default\" which is generally good for all characters and isn't very difficult to role play.3Ability ScoresRead up on what each of them do since they are all useful at a baseline! How you determine your stats is in the distributing ability scores subsection. &#x20;Then after that… 4SkillsSkills generally determine the type of things that your character does that are less specific. Rogues and ninjas might be known for stealth, but anybody can take the skill. Most skills are tailored towards out of combat interactions, but some like athletics, stealth and acrobatics have a variety of applications.5Feat(s)Feats are customization options that usually give static bonuses, new options in combat, and generally serve to tailor your character towards a specific play style.6BackgroundThis section helps inform what your character was up to before they became an adventurer and provides you with unique sets of starting gear.7EquipsDecide what type of weapon/armor you want.All character start off with 1,000g to spend as they wish as well as a jizzle physick (details also in equipment). &#x20;Then finally… 8BackstoryThink about what your character wants, the kinds of tie-ins they have to your world and the kinds of tragic events that happened that led to them brooding in corners of bars.Writing back stories can be fun, but you shouldn't feel obligated to write a specific number of pages or wordcount like it's some silly school assignment. How much you put into table top is how much you get out of it.The most important part of character design is making sure you, your DM and your players are all interested, or at the very least not annoyed, by your character.9?Random ChartsUnder the random charts section, there is a \"character creation\" tab that allows you to decide details about your character if you are uncertain about how big or small, old or young you want your character to be.",

Level 11 Level 11 is an exception to the odd levels rule where most classes will earn some kind of capstone ability: Something that showcases mastery in whatever fighting style they possess. These features are usually purposefully designed to be overpowered and ridiculous. Level 12 Level 12 is the level where all player characters acquire ascensions. Ascensions are mostly class agnostic features that add a lot of customization to the final level in the game.\\ Ascended characters are people that are incredibly significant to the world.

A creature can safely donate an amount of mana equal to their (max-1). There are usually safeguards against donating your max mana, but less savory individuals don't mind. Mana burning your max mana gives you a T3 affliction: Mana Starvation. This means that most common people are only able to donate 1 mana each day. Children typically do not possess enough mana to safely donate. Specialized facilities and gilded altars are incredibly expensive, typically costing 100s of thousands of gold to craft. This makes it so facilities for mana donation tend to be rather sparse, only located in sizable settlements with magical and religious influence. When mana is extracted, it is turned into a mana crystal. Mana crystals are versatile and can change between states of matter, becoming either liquid or solid for ease of storage. Each point of mana can earn 4g in a mana extraction facility. In a church, it earns 5 GBP and food/lodging for the day. Accumulation of Mana Most religious services happen in the evening after work, so that way people may spend their mana as they wish during the day, and donate it at night if they wish. With large generous populations this can mean that you can amass large quantities of mana rather quickly. Because most people can only donate 1 mana, you can almost 1:1 translate a population of donors to daily mana generation. Not everybody who donates has commoner tier mana, but at the same time, not everybody can always donate! So the 1:1 ratio is generally the go-to method of determining mana generation over time. Again, not all places have the correct facilities, so this is often available in villages.",

There are always 2 parties involved in a contract: the summoner and the summoned. Typically it is up to the summoner to convince the summoned to sign the contract, as the magic does not work with unwilling creatures. It is possible to find summoning contracts with a signature from a summoned creature, but not a summoner. Contracts are often temporary, being lifted after a certain number of summons, or after a specific task is complete. When the summoned creature signs the contract in blood, so to must the summoner. The summoned creature takes up a \\[companion] slot while summoned. 1/day as a FRA, you can summon the contracted creature. Creatures summoned in this way always have a pseudo-ethereal translucent quality to them that is easily identifiable (DC 10 arcana). A summon typically only lasts a minute, but can last up to an hour if the summoned creature accepts summoning sickness. The creature also gains summoning sickness if it drops to 0 hp while summoned. Summoning Sickness - A specific type of ailment that occurs as a result of a summoned creature pushing themselves too hard while summoned from a summoning contract, usually by sticking around for too long or being defeated. The creature is drained 2 and cannot be summoned for two weeks, even if the drain is removed. In most aspects, a summoned creature functions exactly as they would if you were fighting by their side in their actual body, with a few key differences. As a magical effect, they can be dispelled (DC 12+summoned creatures lvl). They have all of their gear and any resources that they expend (such as potions) while summoned are still expended when they return to their body. Summoned creatures only have 50% of their max hp. To the summoned creature, when you attempt to summon them, they receive a mental message from their summoner no longer than 2 sentences. They can choose to deny being summoned if they pass a will save (your class DC). If they succeed, they can send 2 sentences back. Otherwise, they enter a trance like state and their spirit leaves their body and appears next to you. If their body takes damage, or is otherwise harmed, then their spirit immediately winks out of existence. A summoned creature can dismiss itself as a standard action. A creature can only be summoned once per day. The more powerful a creature is, the more expensive it is to bind them to a summoning contract. 1,000\\*(1+summoned creatures lvl)^2 | Creatures Level | Contract Cost | | --------------- | ------------- | | 1 | 4,000 | | 2 | 9,000 | | 3 | 16,000 | | … | | | 12 | 169,000 | &#x20;If the contract has a limit on uses, adjust price as below. | # of Summons | Price Adjustment | | ------------ | ---------------- | | 3 | -50% | | 1 | -66% | If the contract has stipulations that limit when the creature can be summoned, halve the cost again.

Average laborers like farmers can be expected to make \\~10-20k gold every year, with the amount increasing with more sophisticated trades such as smiths or merchants. Gold pieces are small coins and are virtually weightless due to the minting process performed by the financial wizards. Another benefit of this minting is it causes gold pieces to naturally stack into specific values (5, 10, 20, 100, 1000).\\ Someone can easily hold 100g in their pockets, 1000g in a dedicated pouch. Anything more and they are bulging at the seams and would be better off with a bank. Roundabout CostDescriptionCheap1 - 100 goldCheap items are purchased several times throughout the day typically.

      "content": "😱 But Who is the Game Master?! Out of everybody in the group, the game master, or GM, is the one who is undoubtedly going to be putting the most effort into the game. It can often feel like a bit of a drawing straws scenario where someone has to put up with the extra work so everybody can enjoy a game. Chances are if you are introducing a new game to your friends, you're going to be the one to run the game since you \"know the rules\" or whatever excuse your buddies come up with. I'm here to tell you you need not fret: Becoming a GM is easy! It's becoming a great GM that's hard. I'll give you a few hints and shortcuts that can make preparing a game from scratch, potentially even for the first time, much easier. Don't start from nothing!\\ Chances are if you're playing this game, you love RPG games, anime, fantasy or all the above. You can steal all kinds of things from your previous experiences. You can steal characters, history, maybe even an entire world from your favorite media. Nintendo isn't going to sue you if you make your exploration game based off of Breath of the Wild. What they won't know won't hurt them. Start saving now.\\ This is not financial advice. No but seriously. I'm still assuming a bit here, but I'm guessing you use something like twitter or YouTube for entertainment. Maybe you're even the artsy type and you browse Deviant Art or Pinterest...Though those places have become AI cesspools...Anyway, you're going to want to fill your worlds with people, places and things! Find pictures and videos that inspire you. Being inspired by something is your creative brain salivating at the idea of making it your own. Whether you find pictures of old ruins you want your players to explore, an awesome monster you want them to fight, or NPCs to fill your towns with, you need these things to make the world feel great. Maybe you can even commission someone if you're feeling generous and need something specific. I learned how to draw just to make pictures of my characters! See how others have done it.\\ Just recently I decided I wanted to include a maze in my game. I have done mazes before, but they were pretty small and included a map. This made it so players could just see where they have been from me getting rid of the fog of war and made it feel like a process of elimination. But what do you do when things are more complicated? What if the maze is too big for a map? What if the maze changes? I wanted to try out something new to get a better maze feel. So I looked up how other people have done their labyrinth sessions. I decided to do something a bit more abstract where things the party found gave them clues and eventually when they gathered enough clues, they found their way through. Not exactly the true misery intended from a labyrinth, but we are trying to have fun after all. I wouldn't have had the idea if others hadn't tried it before me and posted their experience online. Maybe the weird stuff you want to do in your game you can learn from someone else's mistakes too!",

I'll tell you something else, my friends and I look back at the time we first started playing with nostalgia. The experience of learning a new system together with your friends can cause you to butt heads sometimes, but it reveals something incredible that is unique to tabletop: The rules are more like guidelines. Sure they structure play, and you want rules to help you decide how xyz works, but you don't need to follow every rule. I'm not going to call the Tabletop Police Force because you think how this ability works is stupid and what were the developers thinking? I do recommend writing down how you change the rules somewhere though so you can refer back to it. This is a long winded way of me saying learning rules to a complex system takes time, and fumbling through the journey is half the fun. If your worries are that you won't do a good job or you'll forget the rules then make up rules how they make sense to you, or use this incredible website to find the rule. I made this game and I forget the rules, forcing me to have to look things up. Making shit up and altering the game in ways that make it more fun is what TTRPGs are all about.",

      "content": "Pros and Cons of TTRPGs For people unfamiliar who are considering playing Nick Nacks, here are some of the pros and cons of the hobby as a whole. Pros * Never the Same Thing Twice - If you want to talk about replayability, TTRPGs are unmatched. Every story will have moments you never forget, either because of silly moments where you roll bad, or because of epic battles where you almost died.&#x20; * The Perfect Hangout Hobby - If you are just looking for something to do with your friends and you have a lot of spare time, like if you play garbage games like League of Legends, then tabletop is a good substitute.&#x20; * Cost Effective - Going out to eat, see movies or drinking might not cost much one night, but do it every week and it adds up. If you choose TTRPGs as your hobby, you typically only need the up front cost of dice and such, and that's if you play in person. Playing on line with the right combination of programs can be completely free! * True Role-Playing - Many RPG video games will not deliver particularly well on the role-playing side of things, giving you a generic blank slate protagonist and offer little in the way of interesting or compelling choices. TTRPGs let you play whatever you want, do whatever you want and do those things however you want them. Whether you want to go full pacifist, murder hobo or a mix and match approach, you can approach problem-solving in a way no other game can really deliver on. Cons * Time Consuming - In order to get the most out of TTRPGs, you will likely need to play for several hours a sitting, with multiple sittings a month. Lots of people play weekly, around 4 hours each session for potentially dozens of sessions to finish the story. * You get what you put in - Personally, I find this as a pro, but for many it can be a con. If you aren't particularly invested in the story, if you skip many sessions, or if you aren't paying attention to when you are playing, you probably aren't going to enjoy TTRPGs much. I know especially these days it can be difficult for people to put down their phones and have a good time, and TTRPGs are one of those kinds of hobbies. * Scheduling - The sad reality of the hobby is that even if you miraculously find 4 buddies to play with, they wont always be available on Monday night. My personal recommendation is to play no matter how many players show up, even if its only 1. Solo adventures can be fun too! Gives you time to deeply explore the characters closest to the player. \\ Reschedule when you can. If you don't play very often, the game loses momentum and campaigns can slowly fade out of existence.&#x20;",

      "content": "I'm New to Tabletop Role-Playing Welcome! This section will assume you know basically nothing. What is a Tabletop Role-Playing Game (TTRPG) Anybody can play pretend (role-play), but without any structure, things tend to fall apart. TTRPGs seek to create a foundation for you to make stories with your friends (game). They are designed to be played with pen, paper and dice (hence tabletop), but such things can also be substituted for dice rolling programs and sharing your screen over discord. For a game like Nick Nacks, the idea is to let you pretend to be in a living breathing fantasy world where strange creatures like elves and goblins are the norm. It assumes you are playing a small group of people with specialized training and high ambitions. This could mean preventing world ending catastrophes from ancient powerful forces like dragons, or it could mean trying to start up a business in a cutthroat world of magic and mayhem. The moment to moment gameplay typically involves the Game Master (GM) describing environments, mannerisms of people in the world and how the world reacts to the players actions. The GM plays the role of referee and author, writing the framework for the story and arbitrating how events unfold. Players are typically presented with problems, quests and enemies to overcome with clever solutions or overwhelming force.\\ A very simple interaction could involve the following sequence. Game Master - Describes details about a scenario, say an unsavory bar at a coastal town.\\ Player - I want to talk to the unsavory pirates.\\ Player 2 - I'll watch from the sides to make sure nobody gets up to any funny business\\ Game Master - Describes how they react, what they say and how they brandish their weapons when someone unfamiliar approaches.\\ Player 2 - I don't like that. I'll get ready to sneak attack them.\\ Player - Hold on, maybe they're friendly.\\ Game Master - They are most certainly not friendly. Player 2 roll stealth and see if you surprise...Unfortunately they see you coming, roll initiative. Combat is how you will be spending a good amount of your time. Many classes (like fighter) are designed almost exclusively to excel in combat. More details on that below. What is combat? In fantasy, you will encounter a wide variety of problems: Magical rituals that need to be stopped, infestations of giant rats and shapeshifters weaved amongst political allies. Combat is not always necessary, as some players may enjoy trying to solve problems with their wits over their weapons. But combat is inevitable in some situations, where ideals clash and lives are on the line. Some players only really care about the combat. It takes a bit of playing the game yourself to figure out where you fall on the spectrum. Nick Nacks, and games like it, are turn based. The way initiative works guarantees a back and forth battle between the party of players and their foes. One player decides what they want to do, then an enemy, then an ally and so on. You fill your turns with spells and attacks until you complete your goal, none of your enemies remain, they surrender, or you need to make a hasty retreat. Do I have to do a funny voice? The role-playing aspect of Nick Nacks is what sets it apart from many other games like World of Warcraft or Skyrim. These games might advertise themselves as role-playing, but the choices you get to make are usually pretty slim. In skyrim when you approach a locked door, you can either pick it or use a key. Some doors don't even let you pick them for story reasons. Nice thief character! In tabletop when you approach a locked door, you can pick it, you can break it down with raw strength, explosives. You can use magical abilities to circumvent it by shrinking to fit into the key hole. You can dig under or over it. Your ability to solve problems has limitations, but your options are typically only limited to your ability to imagine a solution. Not to mention, this is just a simple problem. Imagine the kinds of creative solutions you'll need to employ during a prison break or finding who is spying on the king! The funny voice is short hand for speaking in character with an accent, and you do it as much as you want. Once upon a time, GMs may have not even allowed people to speak in character. You can use your voice, some other voice, or you can choose to only describe what your character wants to say. You could also just decide to be mute! I'm no voice actor, and I focus more on trying to stay in character more than trying to get any voice right.&#x20; You are playing a game after all, your main priority should be to have fun!",

      "content": "Pros and Cons of Nick Nacks For more experienced TTRPG players, you might already have a good idea of what you like in a system, so this section will (hopefully) be an easy way to figure out if you will like Nick Nacks.&#x20; Pros * Customization - A robust system designed to be played over and over again with characters that feel different every time. Customization with creative character ideas is the number one thing I set out to accomplish in Nick Nacks.&#x20; * Balance - The second highest priority I have, that is absolutely necessary in order to make customization possible, is balance. Games that I have played struggle to maintain balance, particularly in the early/later levels and with their magic systems. I pay very close attention to features when they seem particularly powerful and particularly weak, and make adjustments as needed. * Adaptive - I don't have plans to print anything for this game, and regularly update this website. If a feature ends up a power outlier, or doesn't feel how it should, I will go back and change it to make it better. No longer will you need to wait decades for a new book to come out, contact the developers on twitter or pray your GM rules in your favor. * Free! - This website doesn't have a subscription and is more of a \"pay want you want\" via patreon. If you do what I did when I started playing, you can use dice rolling programs like rolz for your dice needs, discord for voice chat and screen sharing and your art program of choice for battlemaps. Personally I make mine in pain tool sai, then share them in gimp because its easier to move layers around. Sai isn't free, but gimp is a nice alternative for making battle maps. Cons * Incomplete - As a solo developer who cannot dedicate 100% of my time to this project, you will inevitably find certain classes and spell lists with not as much content as you were hoping. You will also find artifacts of me copy and pasting things, or me making large scale rules changes and not catching every single feature it effects. Everything I start, I intend to finish, but starting things is a lot easier than finishing them. * Complex - When I make content, I always make considerations to speed up play, but inevitably if you want a robust system of customization, you increase the complexity of the game. This means that you will likely not be able to remember all the fine details of the hundreds of spells, class features and feats the game has to offer. I tried my best to organize this website as well as I could to make the process of looking things up fast, and because you're playing tabletop, you can adjust things to be more convenient on the fly and look things up later if you don't want to slow things down. * No Game World - One area in particular that will take a very long time to finish that is lower on the priority list is fleshing out a game world. I have introduced several mechanics that have world-building elements built into them such as mana, races and gods. Luckily, most of you probably already have high-fantasy game worlds you like. * D20 System - For the math nerds out there, this can be a problem. The d20 is exceptionally good a delivering highlights and is quite simple. It is probably the most familiar type of action resolution dice, but as a tradeoff it is not the most mathematically sound. With a soft bounded accuracy system like Nick Nacks, its less of an issue, but there will be times where you reach the extremes of the dice and foil the balance I worked so hard to achieve.",

      "content": "Restraint When creatures surrender but you don’t want to risk killing them. Some situations can naturally be neutralized by dropping a cage in the right place, but such conveniences are rare. More often restraining your foe is going to involves rope and cuffs. {% tabs %} {% tab title=\"Cuffs\" %} Poise breaking an already grappled creature allows you to put cuffs on them. This completely prevents the use of their arms outside of simple item interactions. Cuffs can also be placed on the legs to reduce a creatures speed to 15. Combat maneuvers made against a cuffed creature have advantage.\\ Cuffs are difficult to escape, and even harder to break. They typically require outside assistance in order to be removed. Because cuffs are typically made from iron and steel, they can take a significant beating. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Rope\" %} Poise breaking a grappled creature allows you tie them up, having the same effect as applying cuffs. The main difference is that rope is easier to destroy, but it is also easier to make the restraint more intense. By successfully poise breaking a creature a 3rd time, you can prevent the creature from acting completely. Rope tends to be a good way to bind singular creatures without allies, since anybody with a sharp implement can handily free a bound creature. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Dog Pile\" %} By having 3 different creatures simultaneously grappling another creature, you can prevent that creature from acting completely as long as all 3 maintain their grapple. By spending all of your turns, you can move the creature 15 ft a turn.\\ Dogpiles are broken the instant one creatures stops grappling, making them unreliable. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Contained\" %} By succeeding at breaking an already grappled creature's poise, you can forcefully shove them into an object within reach such as a bag, barrel or box, so long as they can handily fit in the object. Whether or not they can escape generally depends on the object and the tools the captured creature has on hand. Wooden crates don’t do to well when trying to hold barbarians or crafty characters with crowbars. {% endtab %} {% endtabs %} Below are more precise details on the DCs to break, unlock and escape if you find yourself in a bind. {% tabs %} {% tab title=\"Cuffs\" %} DC to break (athletics) or lockpick (SoH) is dependent on the type of material. Athletics tends to be less subtle. Solid toughness is DC 25.\\ Adamantine toughness is 35.\\ Transmundane is 40. Creatures that are bound can try to free themselves, but take a -5 penalty. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Rope\" %} Rope can be destroyed with an attack from any slashing weapon.\\ Using athletics you can tear the ropes apart, but the DC is determined by the athletics bonus of the creature who bound you (20+their athletics bonus).\\ Creatures that are bound can try to free themselves, but take a -5 penalty. This penalty can be ignored with a sharp natural attack or concealed weapon. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Contained\" %} DC to break (athletics) is dependent on the type of material. Some objects can be handily dealt with, not requiring a skill check. A knife makes quick work of a bag, and given enough space, hammers break boxes. Fragile toughness is DC 15\\ Average toughness is DC 20.\\ Solid toughness is DC 25.\\ Adamantine toughness is DC 35.\\ Transmundane toughness is DC 40 Creatures that are bound can try to free themselves, but take a -5 penalty. {% endtab %} {% endtabs %}",

If all it takes is a bunch of money and a cleric then rich high level players live in a world without death as a consequence for anybody. Now that we all agree about that, why does resurrection have an expensive material component cost? To punish the players for being unlucky? Why is it locked behind high-level magic? To make playing cleric mandatory? If we only consider the players, then these things become very obvious problems. Players shouldn't be shoehorned into playing specific classes, nor should the money that they worked hard to obtain be required to continue playing the game. The powers that be should instead be very particular about the who gets a second chance. If the players are the main character of the story, then the game's resurrection mechanics should treat them as such. As a replacement for most resurrection effects, use these rules instead.

Has no effect if your speed is zero. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Charge\" %} Action Type: FRA\\ Move at twice your speed in a straight line, halting when your foe is adjacent, or at least within reach. Make your attack(s) against a creature. Creatures get a +2 bonus to attack against you until the start of your next turn. If your charge gets interrupted for whatever reason, you must make your attack(s) from your halted position. You cannot charge a creature that is adjacent to you. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Disengage\" %} Action Type: Standard\\ Completely focus on finding openings in the battlefield. Your movement is \\[elusive] this turn, making it not provoke attacks of opportunity (AoO). {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Jump\" %} Action Type: Swift\\ Can only be used in combination with other forms of movement such as walking or charging. Jump once 5 feet long or half that in height. This does not give you additional movement, and the thus it is limited by your speed. Can be used to avoid difficult terrain or hazards. Jump action can only be made 1/turn. If you dash and take the jump action, you can jump twice with the same swift action. Jump distance increases by 5 ft per point of strength (or dexterity if trained in acrobatics). You cannot jump while standing in a hazardous surface that would normally have some kind of negative effect while moving through it, such as difficult terrain or tripping and falling in an oil spill. You can jump over them just fine, just not if you're already stuck in them. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Potion\" %} Action Type: Swift\\ Retrieve and drink a potion, or similar type of consumable. Provokes AoOs. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Aid\" %} Action Type: Standard\\ Give an ally within your natural reach one of the following bonuses for 1 round: +2 attack, +2 saves, +2 AC. Or get rid of 1 stack of clumsy, shaken, sickened, knockdown. Many effects that entangle and snare can be removed with athletics. You can use the aid action to help an ally escape. You can aid a defeated creature bringing them to 1 hp when not in combat. Extreme circumstances may require more assistance to restore a creature particularly out of it (such as medicine or magic). {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Total Defense\" %} Action Type: Standard\\ Gain DRA 2 until the start of your next turn. Reset your poise. Remove all clumsy stacks. Recover ½ lvl (min 1) mana.\\ You cannot make AoOs until the start of your next turn. {% endtab %} {% endtabs %} * {% tabs %} {% tab title=\"Swap Gear\" %} Action Type: Free\\ At the start of your turn, you can put away what is currently in your hands and pull out new equipment. Functions with weapons, shields, magic items etc. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Administer Potion\" %} Action Type: Standard\\ Give a potion to an unconscious ally. A conscious ally must spend an immediate action to drink an administered potion. You can use either your potions, or potions the ally has. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Delay\" %} Action Type: Free\\ You can decide to wait to act in initiative, acting whenever you like at the end of another creature's turn, permanently changing your position in initiative. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Prepare\" %} Action Type: Varies\\ You can prepare swift actions, movement, free actions and standard actions to react to 1 specific trigger (ex “a goblin opens this door, I walk up to him and shove him off the cliff”). If the triggering action never happens, you don't get your actions back. When you prepare a standard action to attack, you can only prepare a single attack. You cannot prepare actions outside of initiative. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Carry\" %} Action Type: FRA\\ Move your speed and bring a willing creature along with you. If you do not have the carryweight to carry them, then you can double your carryweight to drag them, moving at half speed. If you cannot drag them, you cannot use this action.\\ \\ The creature you carry becomes clumsy 1 unless they are defeated or you aren't in combat.\\ This can be combined with additional actions to gain additional/more varied movement (such as jump or rogue's cunning action).\\ \\ Against incapacitated creatures, you can instead to use a drag combat maneuver. It automatically succeeds and has no range limitation. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Focus\" %} Action Type: Standard Choose a creature you can see. For 1 round you gain the following benefits... * Your movement is \\[elusive] to them * You can take an immediate action as an instant action 1/turn in response to their actions. * You cannot be denied instant/immediate actions against this foe by being DD While you focus on a creature, you pay less attention to all other creatures, and are automatically DD to them. You can choose to continue or end focus on a creature on subsequent turns as a free action. Special - In organized duels, it is assumed both characters start the combat in this state. In such circumstances, they ignore the DD portion of this action (for companions and such). {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Get Down!\" %} Action Type: Immediate\\ Throw yourself into the way of an attack made against a helpless creature. This could mean a minion, someone who is asleep or defeated. You can choose to become the target of all danger aimed at them, including AoE, spells and attacks. Such attacks automatically hit you and you get no saving throws against spells. You naturally need to be aware of an attack to protect against it. If a creature manages to give you the slip with stealth, then you can't protect. If the attack was originally a crit, it crits you instead automatically. {% endtab %} {% endtabs %} *",

All actions are assumed to not function if you aren’t able to react, such as when surprised or stunned, and will be stated otherwise if it can. 1. Full-round action (FRA). Requires all of your movement and your standard action. 2. Standard. What most actions are, like attacking, dashing etc. 3. Swift. A bonus action that is usually of lesser impact than a standard action. 4. Immediate. Swift actions, but they can happen off turn. Usually in response to something. All immediate actions occur before the triggering action. Refreshes at the start of each round. 5. Free. You can perform free actions at any point during your turn at no cost, such as opening a door. Can only do them a reasonable amount of times. 6. Instant. Free actions that can be performed off turn. All instant actions occur before the triggering action. Refreshes at the start of each round. Movement Typically creatures have a speed of 30 ft, if a speed isn't listed, assume 30. You can move before and after performing your other actions. Some abilities or status effects will reduce your movement speed. If your speed is reduced to 0, you cannot move, even if you dash. You can climb and swim at half speed, provided you aren't trying to swim during a storm or climb up a smooth wall. With certain racial/class abilities or proficiency in the athletics skill, you can swim/climb at full speed.",

It takes 30 ft of movement or a standard action to pick up an item off the ground, which provokes an AoO. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Drag\" %} Grab a creature's hair, tail or other loose item on their person and take them for a ride. Target creature stays adjacent to you for the remainder of your turn, allowing you to move them up to 30 ft. This is reduced to 10 feet if they are larger than you and you do not possess exceptional strength with which to carry them. If the creature is not adjacent to you when you successfully drag, they are automatically pulled adjacent to you. You can choose any space within your natural reach to place the creature in at the end of your drag (both of these count against the distance you can drag). {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Dirty Trick\" %} Spit in a creatures eyes, pull down their pants or do some other kind of maneuver to temporarily bother your enemy. Apply clumsy 1, sickened 1 or blurred vision to a creature. They must spend a standard action to get rid of the condition. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Grapple\" %} Get tangled up with a foe, twisting their limbs and holding them still. Your foe are entangled and your speed is zero. Pull the creature adjacent to you. The creature cannot threaten, meaning they cannot flank or make AoOs. Each round you can spend your standard action to keep the target in place and make an attack (but not a multiattack) against them with a melee attack, requiring no roll. If you are moved out of reach from the target, have your poise reduced to zero, or are otherwise unable to maintain your grip, the target is freed. Special: Multiple creatures can grapple one creature. The bonus to attack against a target that is entangled from a grapple increases by 2 per additional creature.\\ Special: You must use at least one prehensile limb to initiate and maintain a grapple on a creature.\\ Special: Creatures ignore the attack penalty from partial and total concealment against creatures that they are being grappled by or are grappling. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Knockdown\" %} Trip your foe, crush their toes or smack them out of the sky. Inflict Knockdown, reducing a creatures speed by 30 and giving all creatures a +2 bonus to attack against them for 1 round. Being knocked down underwater or while airborne might visually be different, but is effectively the same. {% hint style=\"info\" %} But what if I have more than 30 speed? Doesn't that mean I stood up? Do creatures still get a bonus to attack against me? Creatures still get a bonus to attack against you. Getting knocked over represents a slow turn for the knocked down creature. They move unsteadily trying to regain their footing in an ever changing battlefield. \\ \\ If you want more game dev thoughts keep reading.\\ I'll be real with you, in a turn based game this type of effect is a bit hard to accomplish while being in flavor. Similar games have a \"prone\" condition that you can only remove manually on your turn. This makes it so the knocked down creatures position in initiative determines how effective this CC will be. If they immediately go after you when you knocked 'em over, then the CC ends almost immediately. In general I don't like it when initiative position interacts with the power level of features beyond deciding who gets to use abilities first. {% endhint %} {% endtab %} {% endtabs %} {% tabs %} {% tab title=\"Shove\" %} Put your full body behind a push to get an enemy away from you or an ally. Push a creature 10 feet in a direction away from you. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Sunder\" %} Damage your foe's gear by cutting holes in it or bending it out of shape. Target a piece of your opponent's equipment. With a different effect depending on the item you target. * Attacks made against a creature with sundered armor get a +1 bonus. * Bucklers give you a -2 penalty on attempts to parry * Shields no longer grant poise, and cannot be used to perform special attacks * Weapons cannot be used to perform special attacks * Spells cast from a broken staff/seal have their CL reduced by 2 (min 0).&#x20; * Magic items cannot be activated for 1 minute.

Poise determines how difficult you are to toss around. It functions similarly to hp, but you subtract the attack roll from the target's poise. If this reduces them to 0 poise, they suffer the effects of the maneuver and their poise resets to maximum. Poise naturally resets after combat ends or by taking the total defense action. Other effects that toss characters around might also interact with poise. If poise is reduced via lowered stats without a combat maneuver being used, it drops to a minimum of 1 (unless otherwise specified). Using a combat maneuver replaces melee attacks by default. Poise is calculated as follows. Common things like armor, shields and feats add to poise. All bonuses to poise stack. 10 + (level) + (strength) + (dexterity) + (armor/shields) + (class) + (etc) Any damage reduction also applies to poise damage. Combat maneuvers by default have the \\[Martial] tag, allowing you to use the attack, damage and bonus effects of a held weapon or natural attack, even if it states you use another attack form.",

Entity that inflicted this condition has a +4 bonus on charisma skills against this creature. Immediately ends if the creature that inflicted the condition harms the charmed creature. Charmed creatures always interpret what the creature that charmed them is doing in the most positive light: Punches and sword swings are massages and surgeries.

A taunted creature can only move if the movement puts them closer to the creature that taunted it. A creature who is taunted MUST take some type of aggressive option, and cannot use their turn to support allies, or heal themselves, unless such actions would also be an attack against the taunter. A creature taunted by 2 or more creatures may decide between the 2 creatures which they'd like to attack.

Creatures not currently engaged in combat cannot be taunted. {% endtab %} {% endtabs %} Elemental Status {% tabs %} {% tab title=\"Ablaze\" %} When a creature is set ablaze, it takes 2d8 (9) fire damage at the start of each turn. Attacks made against the target get a +2 bonus for 1 round. Before taking damage on the second turn, and every subsequent turn, roll a reflex save to end effect.

Constant effects, effects from items, or effects that were already cast remain in effect. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Time Out\" %} A creature in time out has lost the will to fight. They cannot inflict harmful effects on anybody or anything. They also cannot cast spells without your permission. They meekly follow your commands (ex. follow me), but don’t do anything against their ethos (kick that puppy) or that is dangerous (jump off that cliff) without extreme circumstances.&#x20; If you or your allies attack the creature or cast a harmful spell on it, the condition ends. Treat it like a slightly more convenient form of unconsciousness if you want to interact with the creature after the combat.\\ Many minion-type creatures will acquire this status effect when their leader is defeated. {% endtab %} {% endtabs %}",

Techniques is an umbrella term for special moves given to martials and mages alike. Mana Basics In order to use a technique, you must spend mana equal to the tier of technique. Cantrips have an effective tier of 0 and do not cost mana. While not in immediate danger (such as combat or a chase), you regenerate 1 mana per turn, or 10 mana per minute. * | Lvl | Mana | Tier/Costs | Mana Cap | | --- | ---- | ---------- | -------- | | 0 | 2 | | 2 | | 1 | 4 | 1 | | | 2 | 6 | | | | 3 | 8 | 2 | 3 | | 4 | 10 | | | | 5 | 12 | 3 | 4 | | 6 | 14 | | | | 7 | 16 | 4 | 5 | | 8 | 18 | | | | 9 | 20 | 5 | 6 | | 10 | 22 | | | | 11 | 24 | 6 | 7 | | 12 | 26 | | | Upcast By spending more mana, you can increase the effectiveness of abilities with the \\[upcast] tag. The degree to which varies by ability. Just because you have enough mana in your pool does not mean you can upcast an ability. In order to upcast, you must meet a certain level requirement (see mana basics above) in addition to increasing the mana cost. For example Imagination has options up to upcast 5, effectively making that option a level 5 technique, requiring you to be level 9 to use it.&#x20; Mana Reserves Mana reserves function exactly like your base mana, except they disappear after used, and only regenerate after you rest. Mana reserves are gained through having positive intelligence, are sometimes given to mage classes and through magic items, often with particular restrictions on their use. Mana Burn Abilities with the tag \\[mana burn] either reduce your max mana, or have an optional more powerful use case that reduces your max mana. Reduces by 1 unless stated otherwise. Usually goes away on rest. If an ability does not mention a mana cost, then it still reduces current and max mana by 1 if it has the mana burn tag.",

Advantage and Disadvantage There are many abilities in the game that allow you additional odds success in some limited capacity. These are usually represented through rerolls and advantage. Rerolls do as they might suggest; they allow you to roll dice again after you didn't like the result. Whenever you use a reroll on a dice roll that you have advantage or disadvantage on, you make that reroll with advantage or disadvantage. Advantage allows you to roll 2 dice and take the desired of the 2 results. Inversely, disadvantage forces you to roll 2 dice and take the lower of the 2 results. Multiple instances of advantage allow you to roll the dice more, 3, 4, maybe even 5 times and take the desired result. Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out. * If that’s confusing, treat advantage as +1 and disadvantage as -1 in the chart below. | -3 | Etc. | | -- | -------------------------- | | -2 | Roll 3 dice, take lowest | | -1 | Roll 2 dice, take lowest | | 0 | Roll 1 dice | | +1 | Roll 2 dice, choose result | | +2 | Roll 3 dice, choose result | | +3 | Etc. | Attacks of Opportunity (AoOs) An attack of opportunity is an instant action attack a creature makes in response to an action that is generally unsafe or unwieldy. AoOs always happen before the triggering action. AoOs can typically only be made with melee weapons. Without the combat reflexes feat, creatures can only make 1 AoO, resetting at the top of initiative. Common things that provoke: * Making a ranged attack * Leaving an opponent's threatened spaces * Strafing Strafing is movement inside of an opponents threatened spaces that does not move you directly closer to it. IE walking around the creature in order to get into a flanking position or moving past them to get to another enemy while not leaving their threatened spaces. In essence, while threatened, you can't ignore the creature. A creature that is unable to take a standard action cannot make attacks of opportunity.\\ If a creature has total concealment, they cannot be AoO’d.\\ AoOs are simple attacks by default.\\ AoOs do not suffer the multi-attack penalty Luck Checks When the chance something will happen or fail to happen is based purely on chance, you attempt a luck check. You roll a d20, add (or subtract) luck and compare the result on the die to the DC. You can't add your luck to a luck check twice. Nothing else can be added to luck checks (unless otherwise specified). Fall Damage Fall damage increases by 3 crush for every 10 feet you fall, capped at 60 damage. Every 50 feet you are also drained 1, capped at 4. Fall damage also deals poise damage equal to hp damage. Your poise drops to zero as a result of fall damage, you or knocked down. Mounted Combat Mounting can be done as a swift action on an adjacent creature. The mounting creature must be 1 size category smaller than the mount. You cannot mount a creature if your speed is reduced to zero. If the creature does not have equipment to facilitate mounting, combat maneuvers have advantage against you. If you or your mount are toppled or shoved, you are dismounted in addition to the combat maneuver's effects. High Ground In order to have high ground, you need to at least have a 10 ft elevation on them. When you have high ground, you ignore the attack penalty for ranged weapons in the second increment.",

      "content": "⚔️ Attack Rolls Attack rolls are any type of harmful effect targeting a creature that does not require a saving throw. This can be spells, swords or trying to push your foe off a cliff | Default: | d20+(lvl)+(ability score)+/-(circumstances) | | -------- | ------------------------------------------- | In general AC is not a zero sum endeavor. If you successfully meet the AC number, you deal full damage.\\ if you roll 10 higher than the AC number, you crit.\\ If you roll under the AC number, but not by more than 5, you get a partial hit as you \"graze\" your opponent with your attack. Attack Progression Creatures that aren't dual-wielding have only 1 attack by default. When you use your standard action to make multiple attacks, it's called a multi attack. You can distribute the attacks to creatures as you see fit, move in between them, before and after them (for certain AoE attacks like cleave, you usually need to stand still). By default a standard attack is considered a simple attack. Simple attacks are only rolling attack and damage, typically with no special effects tied to them. Special attacks allow for more versatility in play style. Unique weapons, class abilities, techniques and feats can grant these special attacks. Special attacks can usually only be performed once per turn.&#x20; Special attacks universally have the \\[martial] tag, allowing you to use the attack, damage and bonus effects of a held weapon or natural attack, even if it states you use another attack form, such as the transformation effects of the Beastmode technique tree, or tossing your foes around in Barbarism. Grazing Grazing a foe with your attack halves the damage. To graze a foe, you must roll a value of at least their AC-5. In addition to dealing half damage, you do not apply any on-hit effects, such as bleed. Most effects that require an attack roll, are assumed to be on hit effects. Effects that have an effect when you are \"missed\" also happen when you are grazed.&#x20; If there is some type of effect that happens when a creature is attacked, such as the mimics sticky quality, this effect also triggers when they are grazed. Critical Hits (crits) Crits multiply all damage by 1.5. This increases to 2x damage with a two-handed weapon.\\ Crits automatically happen when you exceed a creature's AC by 10. Dual-Wielding You can wield weapons in both hands as long as they both have the light property. Whenever you make an attack against a creature (unless combat maneuver) with one of your weapons (the \"main hand\"), you can make an additional simple attack (that cannot be replaced with any other type of attack) against the same creature with the other weapon (the \"off hand\") . Because you strike with the 2 weapons in tandem, if the \"main hand\" attack is enough to defeat a creature, you cannot make an \"off hand\" attack against a different creature. If you make a special attack that involves making multiple attacks, such as the cleave special attack, you can only make the \"off hand\" attack against the first creature you attack with it. If the special attack grants some special property to the weapon, like weapon toss allowing you to throw any weapon, it does not do so for the off-hand unless specified otherwise. If you gain additional limbs to wield weapons, you do not get more \"main hand\" or \"off hand\" attacks by default. You cannot dual wield with natural attacks or unarmed strikes by default. What's in your hands? What occupies your character's hands at any given time is very important. With only 2 hands, you're often going to need to make some sacrifices to do what you want on a given turn. With the versatility of the \"swap gear\" action, you can always adapt to the situation. Spellcasting in this game requires occupying a hand with a magical focus, weapons take up hands, shields and you still might want empty hands for interacting with objects or grappling. This might not seem like much, but with how much everybody gets increased access to magic, you're going to find a lot more people with staves at the ready. Some weapons require you use 2 hands to wield them. If you choose to let go with one of your hands such as to wield a stave, grapple a creature or fiddle with some factory controls, you cannot attack with the 2h weapon until the start of your next turn.&#x20;",

      "content": "Initiative Nick Nacks is a turn-based game, and initiative decides who goes first One of the players rolls a d10. On a 6 or higher, the players go first, or a 5 or lower, the enemies go first. On the first round of combat, whichever party went first decides which creature acts first. Then you swap to the other party and they decide who goes. You repeat this process until either every creature has acted, or one side has several creatures that haven't acted. All remaining creatures act on the same turn and then you start back from the top, using the same order as round 1. {% hint style=\"warning\" %} When initiative is rolled, all \\[buff] effects disappear automatically (unless its duration is longer than 1 minute). This is to discourage spamming buffing spells and then waiting to recover mana. {% endhint %} What happens when we start fighting in the middle of talking? In the event where there are two parties that don't immediately fight, when initiative starts is usually determined by whenever someone takes an aggressive action, such as casting a spell or drawing an arrow. In these cases, where both parties are aware of each other, initiative gets rolled immediately before any actions happen.&#x20; Certain types of underhanded tactics can get around this, such as using sleight of hand to draw concealed weapons or deception for a sucker punch. See surprise for more details. Surprise In most types of DnD-style games, if you get the jump on your opponent, the sneaky party gets an entire turn to themselves. This is not the case in Nick Nacks. The conventional \"surprise round\" is now a normal round in combat.&#x20; All characters that are surprised lose are DD during the first round, and the surprising party always goes first in initiative. Surprise can be a bit finicky sometimes, making you question if only some characters should be surprised. If that's what your gut tells you, that's how it is.&#x20; For example, your party's rogue who was hiding in an alley ambushes a group of guardsmen that are harassing the rest of the party. The guard captain notices but his men do not. Captain is not DD, the rest are.",

      "content": "\\[Tags] Tags are descriptors that let you apply general rules to similar effects. Tags are not just limited to spells, but spells do commonly use tags. Tags are always denoted with \\[brackets]. Certain tags may only effect specific parts of a spell. {% tabs %} {% tab title=\"Buff\" %} An effect with the buff tag grants a boon to a creature. A creature can only have one effect with the buff tag affecting them at once. If an unwilling creature has a buff used on it, it can choose to deny it. {% hint style=\"warning\" %} Sometimes when you want dramatic moments, you have to stop and chat with the big bad or make some heroic speech. During such times, buffs do not time out. Let the scene play out instead of RUSH HIM DOWN BEFORE MY BUFF RUNS OUT. {% endhint %} {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Bond\" %} Bonds are interpersonal effects that bond you to another creature in some way. They are types of lesser buffs often favoring functionality over power. They do not take your buff slot. Can be denied automatically just like a buff spell. You can have an unlimited number of bond effects on you. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Contingent\" %} The effect can be used ahead of time with a specific trigger for when it activates. A creature can only have a single contingent effect active on them at once. The effect manifests as a clearly visible wisp of energy with a question mark on it that floats around the creature The DC to identify the effect increases by 5. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Concentration\" %} An effect with the concentration tag requires some degree of upkeep from the caster and typically has a duration. You can only have one concentration effect active at once. Concentration effects end if the caster is defeated, fascinated, stunned, put to sleep or otherwise completely prevented from taking any actions. You can also cease concentration as an instant action if desired. If you cast a spell with concentration, you must hold the staff in order to maintain your concentration. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Companion\" %} If a spell has the companion tag, it summons an ally, or otherwise serves some kind of interpersonal function. You can only have 2 companions, or 1 if you have negative charisma. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Charm\" %} Charm effects allow the creature inflicting it to exert some degree of control over others. All charm effects are also \\[mind-affecting]. {% endtab %} {% endtabs %} {% tabs %} {% tab title=\"Curse\" %} Curse effects inflict permanent debilitating conditions on creatures. Curses cannot be dispelled, but they all have some way to get rid of them, usually requiring some convoluted thing most wouldn't normally do unless prompted.\\ Can be identified using the \"identify curse or affliction\" feature in the medicine skill. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Dmg Type\" %} Effects that deal damage have a tag that tells you what damage type it does, with the following types...\\ \\[Force], \\[Zap], \\[Frost], \\[Fire], \\[Poison], \\[Sonic], \\[Psychic], \\[Holy], \\[Necrotic] If a effect deals multiple damage types it lists all of them. If you can choose between different types then it gets the appropriate tag when you choose a specific element. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Darkness\" %} Effects with the darkness tag either create darkness, or have special interactions when in it. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Dismissable\" %} Dismissable effects can be ended prematurely by the caster as a standard action. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Elemental\" %} Elemental effects manipulate elements that don’t necessarily have damage types associate with them. Elemental effects can have the \\[air], \\[earth] and \\[water] tags. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Elusive\" %} Actions/movement ignore the usual rules for AoOs and do not provoke any AoOs. Frequently appears in subsections of abilities. {% endtab %} {% endtabs %} {% tabs %} {% tab title=\"Fear\" %} Usually inflicts shaken or frightened. All fear effects are also \\[mind-affecting]. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Figment\" %} Figments create creatures and terrain that don’t truly exist. As long as the creature does not directly interact with a figment, it believes it to be real. If a creature figures out that it's fake and tells its allies, or demonstrates by walking through it, they no longer believe it to be real. Directly interacting requires doing things like walking into a wall or attacking a creature, upon which the creature makes a will save. A failure indicates the creature will try to run around an obstacle or that they missed a creature. If used to satisfy the conditions of a surrender (such as making a spooky monster). The creatures affected get a will save to negate it. They have advantage on this save if they saw you cast the spell. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Glamer\" %} A glamer changes a subject’s sensory qualities, making it look, feel, taste, smell, or sound like something else, or nothing at all. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Healing\" %} This effect heals hp, gives temp hp, or gets rid of debilitating status effects.\\ \\[Healing] effects cannot bring creatures above 75% hp. Healing in excess of 75% hp is converted to temp hp. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Light\" %} Effects with the light tag either create light, or have special interactions when in it. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Language\" %} Language effects require the target to understand your spoken words, or requires some form of clear communication that mimics language (like telepathy). {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Mana Burn\" %} Abilities with the tag \\[mana burn] either reduce your max mana, or have an optional more powerful use case that reduces your max mana. Reduces by 1 unless stated otherwise. Usually goes away on rest. If an ability does not mention a mana cost, then it still reduces current and max mana by 1 if it has the mana burn tag. {% endtab %} {% endtabs %} {% tabs %} {% tab title=\"Mind-Affecting\" %} Mind affecting effects are a more general group that include things like fear effects, charms and more. \\ Creatures that are mindless (that do not possess an intelligence score) cannot be affected by mind-affecting effects. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Martial\" %} Martial effects allow the user to deliver the effect using the attack and damage and on-hit effects of a wielded weapon, even if it mentions using another form of attack.&#x20; Special attacks by default ALWAYS have the martial tag. It is not listed to save time/space. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Overheal\" %} This healing effect is particularly powerful. When healing from an overheal effect exceeds the targets maximum hp, the remainder is converted into temp hp. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Pattern\" %} Like a figment, a pattern creates an image that others can see, but a pattern also affects the minds of those who see it or are caught in it. Common effects include fascination or blurred vision. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Polymorph\" %} Polymorph effects transform creatures into other creatures. Many of the features granted from polymorph effects are based off the Shapeshifter's class features. You retain the ability to speak while polymorphed. When transforming using a polymorph effect, it can fall under one of a the following categories to determine the nature of your transformation (some can be multiple).&#x20; Chimeric Shape - Your form stays roughly the same, but acquires some features of the new creature that you're transforming into, such as claws, fur, a long tongue etc. When you chimeric shape, you do not lose access to any of your gear. True Polymorph - Your form completely changes to the form mentioned in the ability. You completely lose access to all of your equipment, but can still speak. There are only be a handful of features recognizable from your previous self, such as eye color. Baleful Polymorph - This form of polymorph is inflicted upon you rather than willingly used. It functions very similarly to true polymorph, but provides fewer tangible benefits and includes debuffs. You do lose access to your equipment and cannot speak. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Persistent\" %} This effect creates something that has an initial effect and an effect that persists over time. This type of effect has a cooldown on its damage. This cooldown is until the end of an affected creatures turn. {% endtab %} {% endtabs %} {% tabs %} {% tab title=\"Recharge\" %} This effect has a cooldown, or some kind of specific mechanic to use repeatedly. If no cooldown is listed, then it is assumed to be only be usable 1/day. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Subtle\" %} The effect has a chance for nobody to notice it. If the target creature fails its save, then the effect goes unnoticed. The DC to identify a spell with the subtle tag increases by 5. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Scrying\" %} Scrying effects create a specific type of magic sensor that allow you to perceive the world through another creature's eyes and ears. Typically it requires a standard action to swap between you and the creature's perspective While you focus through another creature, you use all of the creature's senses, but your own perception bonus. You are also stunned. Taking any damage causes you to snap back to your body and stuns you for an additional turn..&#x20; {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Sigil\" %} The effect puts magical text on a surface with some kind of delayed effect, usually triggering when a creature walks within a certain radius of the sigil. A sigil must be clearly visible in order to function. If it is obscured, then it is deactivated until it is unobscured. Most sigils have the ability to apply a passphrase that when spoken aloud, allows a user to move through the area without triggering the sigil. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Teleportation\" %} Teleportation effects allow the user and their allies to use the astral plane as a shortcut to get to places far away. Teleportation tends to be very limited in scope, bringing you to very specific predetermined places or being wildly off course if not. Unless otherwise stated, you must have line of sight to the location you are teleporting to. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Upcast\" %} By spending more mana, you can increase the effectiveness of the spell. The degree to which varies by spell.\\ In order to upcast a spell, you must meet a certain level requirement in addition to increasing the mana cost. For example Imagination (Moogen 1) has an options up to upcast 5, effectively making that option a level 5 technique, requiring you to be level 9 to use it.&#x20; {% endtab %} {% endtabs %}",

Must match type . * Lore NumbersAmazon tend to be around 6'6 and weigh around 250 lbsAmazon are adults by 15, tend to maintain their youth until their 60s, then experience the usual physical decline, tending to live until about 100Appearance and BiologyAmazon typically appear similar to other humanoids, but with a much larger build. They are tall mesomorphs that tend to have a lot of variety, even within the same family. Amazon exclusively birth other amazon and are always female. Because of their inability to interbreed with each other, they must seek other races to maintain their population. This results in a larger degree of variety than most other races, inheriting varying skin colors, tusks, horns etc.Amazon typically wear armor, but the armors tend to be more \"tribal\" in appearance. That is to say they use materials on hand like animal pelts or bone. Amazon typically grow attached to specific trinkets they collect during their adventures: Special hats, jewelry etc. It is incredibly common for Amazon to have elaborate body and face tattoos, typically being more pattern focused than being of specific objects or creatures, and always avoiding the eyes. Amazon particularly desperate for male attention will wear what their sisters call \"horny armor\" which practically provides little protection and only serves to draw the gaze of potential mates.Scenic NowhereAmazon typically only live in smallish communities of only a few hundred in the far off reaches of the world, where they typically aren't bothered: Icey peaks, deep jungles and volcanic wastes. This makes actually finding their home very difficult for an outsider, but an Amazon always has a 6th sense for how she might return home. Amazon often have unique adaptations that allow them to exist sustainably in such harsh environments. Sometimes this comes in the form of hunting or farming techniques, others it means biological adaptation to extremes in temperature.Amazon are typically wary of outsiders when close to home. Each tribe have a different policy depending on their history, but typically outsiders are judged by those most knowledgeable, the elders or by their chieftess. The chieftess is usually the most powerful and influential member of a particular tribe and is treated with great respect. A slight against the chieftess is a slight against the family as a whole, and is a quick way to get kicked out, or worse depending on the practices of that tribe.FamilyAmazon have a particularly close bond with their family. They all share the same last name and rarely choose to change it, seeing their heritage as something to take pride in. They greatly emphasize the \"it takes a village to raise a child\" philosophy and every child is everyone's responsibility. As such the role of childbearing is seen less of a personal responsibility and more of a commitment to the continuation of the family. The role of mom specifically is also deemphasized, but what mother wouldn't show a bit of preferential treatment to one of their own. Amazon can typically expect their sisters, and especially their elders, to pick up on any slack with regards to child rearing as a result of being stretched thin by responsibilities. Amazon typically return back home if they experience great hardship, grow old or find a partner/get pregnant.To an Amazon, there is no greater threat than one that threatens their tribe. They will take up arms against anything if it threatens their way of life, and may be willing to resort to anything in order to protect their kin.Adventures and DuelsNearly every young Amazon is expected to leave home at some point, usually in pairs with a sister of similar age. There is always the underlying goal of hoping to find love, but rarely is that the priority. They go out to perform specific tasks, carry on where their older sisters left of, or to simply make a name for themselves. As such they often find themselves living off the land and doing small jobs where they learn what was fact and what was fiction from all the stories they heard from their sisters growing up: The \"civilized\" world can often be just as cruel as the harsh biome they hail from, but in entirely new and frustrating ways. Things like land ownership and bumping heads on tiny doorways are oft-sited frustrations with most civilization.Regardless of style, all Amazon are combat-trained. As such, scrappy folks looking to test their mettle will challenge amazon to battles. Amazon will usually accept duels with females if they're in the mood, but will only duel males they are interested in or attracted to. If the amazon is victorious, they usually lose interest.BanishmentIt does not happen often, but when an amazon betrays her family or does something the tribe sees as particularly heinous, they are banished: A specific type of mask-like tattoo is placed over their eyes that is always visible, even through magical transformations. Only through physically covering the face can the tattoo be hidden. The banished is stripped of their family name and forbidden from returning back home. Being banished from one tribe guarantees a life of hardship, as the tattoo is a universal sign to all amazon, making the banished unable to ever establish the bond of kinship again. Amazon instinctually detect and distrust any creature that bears the mark of the banished.",

Rarely will they ever see it that way though. The more colorful and eccentric someone is, the better they fit in with a crowd of anime. Anime are obsessed with being unique and will do everything in their power to make sure they have a different hair color, eye color, outfit, hair styles etc. They care deeply about being noticed. If anybody ever mentions their appearance, that is reinforcement that they are doing something right. Outside of these eccentricities, anime tend to closely resemble humans. Their skin and hair have a lot more luster that other humanoids. They can have deviations in their eyes, not only in their size, but also the shape of their irises. They also can sometimes have unusual extra features like the sharp teeth of a predator, an extra pair of ears on top of their head or whiskers.Main QuestAnime always have some major event that they cling to during their childhood that shapes their life forever. Tragic deaths and witnessing incredible feats of heroism are the most common, but it could also be something inconsequential like being a virgin or not having any friends. Either way, this event will put the anime down a specific path to get vengeance, be the best there ever was or watch the world burn. As such, they always spend their teenage years and early adulthood in pursuit of this goal by getting special training, isolating themselves in their research and such. Anime always make grandiose claims about their desires like \"I want to become king\" or \"I want to be the strongest under the heavens\" with regards to these desires. Once they get their fill of adventure or they accomplish their goal is when they typically settle down and live a normal life. Occasionally anime can be tempted to come out of retirement if a rival shows up or enemy they had thought defeated rears its head.Cranked up to 11Anime are always the most extreme version of whatever they embody. They are the most comically evil villain's, the most epic heroes and the dumbest drunks. They dive headfirst into things without even realizing what they are doing. Anime always go all in, rarely consider future consequences and regularly trust people they shouldn't. Anime also have the most intense reactions to things. Disgust causes them to turn purple and anger turns them red while they blow steam from their ears. They make tons of vocalizations to express their current emotional state.",

They weigh about 15% of their original body weight.Boners live to be about 50 before the animating force leaves their bones for goodAppearanceBoners are the skeletons of humanoid creatures and vary a bit in shape and size based on their original race. Since their bodies are without skin and only bones, they are often mistaken for the nefarious creations of necromancers, but boners try to mitigate that with an extreme sense of style. They wear fancy outfits, outrageous hats and use their boney bodies as a canvas for artistic expression. It isn’t uncommon to see a Boner embed gems into their body, give themselves extensive tattoos or apply trails of melted gold in their cracked bones.A particularly unusual feature they possess is the ability to bend parts of their skulls. This allows them to make facial expressions (imagine Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy). Most possess glowing lights in their sockets to replace their eyes.VitalityBoners are the cure for undeath. They possess the ability to free the soul of the undead creature, granting it control over what's left of its body. Not only are they able, but they are obsessed with the idea of curing undead. You'd be hard pressed to find creatures with a greater distaste for undead. Most make it their mission to free what they see as imprisoned brothers and sisters.Vitality only works when exposed to the gas over a prolonged period of time, requiring undead to be captured instead of killed. Usually the process takes about 10 minutes for most undead, but particularly powerful ones can take hours or even days. Even undead that were quite fond of their previous forms have a drastic change in their mindset and are immediately disgusted by what they had become.'Til Death Do Us PartBoners typically remember very little, if anything, from their previous life, usually writing it off as déjà vu. Some of their personality remains intact and they have the same general shape, but most of their previous selves was erased when they washed ashore in the underworld through the river Styx. They do remember everything they experienced while an undead monster.The quest to cure the world of necromancy is an impossible one, but it is one the boners accept with gusto, as it means they get to increase the size of their family. Boners develop a closeness with their with their captures. They always develop a very close bond with the first creature that cure, unless that creature already had a partner. Lacking biology, they don’t care much for physical intimacy and pay little attention to gender or even species. Subsequent cures while a boner already has a partner are treated more like children. These comparisons are imprecise, considering most boners are of adult creatures and it can be difficult for most to imagine an intimate relationship without a physical component, but it serves as an easy way to explain to the meatbags.",

They usually tend to be 5'6 tall and weigh 350 lbsShadow Builds are typically half as tall and 1/4 the weightBots of Burden are typically 1.5x as tall and 4x the weight.The lifespan of a cyborg is dependent on the creature used to create them. See creation and death for more info.Creation (and Death)Through a combination of engineering and magic, a talented individual can use the body of a creature who is recently deceased or on deaths door as a chassis for a cyborg. By augmenting the creature with replacement mechanical parts that circumvent the biological failings of a creature's meat parts, and offering a piece of their own soul, the creator can breathe new life into a completely new type of creature.Theoretically with frequent repairs, a cyborg can live forever. However due to the soul sharing being a necessary part of the process, the life of the cyborg is inevitably tied to that of their creator. When their creator dies, they take the piece of the soul that resides in their creation with them. This does not immediately kill the cyborg, but rather gives them a sickness that is similar to dementia that slowly eats away at their mental faculties until nothing remains.Appearance and BiologyThe aesthetics of a cyborg tend to be augmented humanoid: Limbs replaced by mechanical parts, additional seams in the skin to accommodate for added flexibility and visible nodes/circuits to channel electricity. Other than that, the cyborg's appearance tends to be based on the preferences of the creator and the body of the creature that was used in the process of creation.When it comes to what gets taken out and replaced with mechanical parts, that largely depends on the state the subject was in before the process of being turned into a cyborg. Ailments that affected mobility typically mean mechanical limbs, while those related to organ failure can cause most of the augmentations to be made internally. Either way there are usually new ways the creature can bend and new holes to accommodate for their constant need for electricity and fuel instead of food and water.Most of the engineers tend to favor function over form, but on occasion they can be compelled to keep particular biological functions in tact to make the cyborgs blend in better such as a digestive system or reproductive organs. Regardless, they do not appear to age, only physically changing in so far as they are repaired and augmented further.What is My PurposeCyborgs inevitably need to have their brain essentially wiped clean as part of the creation process. In order to avoid total mental collapse, the creators need to fill that space in with something else: a purpose. Usually a creatures build and purpose coincide with each other: A sleek build honed for stealth built to assassinate political rivals. Quick reflexes to counteract opponents in combat. No matter the purpose, the cyborgs are invariably bound by it, and must dedicate a large portion of their time to it. There is no finite amount of time a cyborg must schedule, but usually they must dedicate hours each day to their purpose, even if the task is indirect (I must protect my creator, therefore I will shop for them and buy them armor). Though even indirect methods will not substitute directly attending to their build purpose forever. If a cyborg spends too much time avoiding their purpose, they acquire a severe affliction called purposelessness (details below).Free WillCyborgs are like children when first created; they know little and are curious about everything. This usually passes quickly since they still have the mental faculties of an adult. Creators will quickly find them changing roles from parent to taskmaster as cyborgs are eager for direction. Once given the tools to do so, cyborgs can act completely independently. Though the words of their creator tend to carry more weight.Cyborgs might not have any biological memories from their previous life, but the memories of the soul remain. They leak into their unconscious thoughts and still serve as a guide for them concerning matters of morality. They might not remember the events that created these feelings, but the lessons they learned from them stick for good. As such, they function as and are usually treated like individuals rather than servants. Though to the cyborg that line can be blurry. Purposelessness (Tier 3 Affliction) EffectCureCyborg loses its free will and must achieve its purpose at all costs. It is obtained through abstaining from this purpose and so usually involves overcompensating for lost time. This could mean aggressively assisting creatures without them asking for it, picking fights for no other reason than to fight. Cyborgs are much more impressionable and will often do anything asked of them if it is aligned with their purpose while in this state.Receiving a direct order in line with their purpose from creator requiring at least 1 day and completing it without rest.If creator is unavailable, then after 1 week of constantly serving their purpose without rest, they become drained 2 and the affliction is lost.",

Rather than reproducing through traditional means, they go mining to find more dwarves. Dwarves are a naturally occurring resource just like iron, and can be harvested as such. They usually appear inside of stone-y egg-like structures with the texture of hair. These eggs naturally form as a result of \"dwarf energy\" which is created through the act of mining. Dwarfling eggs can only form in unworked stone, making it necessary to go far out from home to find them. More dwarf energy is generated when dwarves mine, and dwarves have a more keen sense when it comes to finding dwarfling eggs, making it uncommon for other humanoids to discover them. There are a handful of ways to hatch a dwarfling egg. Some use specific solvents like a shampoo to soften the protective outer beard shell while others warm it up and comb at it when it softens. When hatched, dwarflings start off a bit more developed then birthed humanoids. With roughly a year head start, they can already move around on their own, eat most foods and understand basic physics.Dwarves are easily identifiable from their wide frames, short statures and incredible beards. They typically have a higher density of muscles and hair than most other humanoids. They take exceptional care of their facial hair, prioritizing it over the hair on the top of their head. Dwarves hatch with beards, so it is very rare to see one without a beard. Average dwarves tend to be wary of beardless dwarves.Vibe CheckBecause dwarves have completely different biology when it comes to reproducing, their family structure doesn't follow that of creatures that give birth to their own young. Instead, dwarflings stick with whoever mined them during their early years. By the time they are teenagers, they can get a feel for their immediate family and decide whether or not they are a good fit for them. As such, dwarves form families (called Brotherhoods) similar to how most people find friend groups. Dwarves who don’t click with the family they were hatched into will readily leave to go find people that share ideals/lifestyle more closely.Dwarves that are part of a brotherhood share the same name, but are willing to drop it when they change or they think the brotherhood 'aint what it used to be. Dwarves who don't vibe with the local brotherhoods have a tendency to wander around the overworld until they find a nice craftsman or adventuring party to latch onto. Dwarves innately have a strong ability to read people, making this somewhat naïve approach to finding family more viable. Just because a dwarf is traveling doesn't automatically mean they aren't part of a brotherhood. Sometimes it is necessary to do business with surface dwellers.Round Up The LadsBecause dwarves do not have genders, they are a lot less sensitive to the kinds of dynamics having sexual dimorphism causes in humanoids. It can take a bit of getting used to not bathing or taking a leak in the presence of ladies. Dwarves tend to treat women of other races just like the men. This comes with a whole host of problems, but it also comes with a few positives. A woman having a dwarf friend is a bit like having a woman having a gay guy friend, where they can feel at ease knowing that the dwarf isn't looking for every opportunity to get into her pants.Dwarves tend to express masculine ideals much more frequently. They enjoy one upping each other when it comes to tests of strength and especially endurance. A favorite is the drinking contest, which most dwarves will handily win. Unfortunately for suitors, they are also aromantic, making such advances made against them fly right over their head.Secrets of the DwarvesLarger brotherhoods or groups willing to cooperate can sometimes get up to some…Interesting shenanigans when it comes to the experimentation on dwarflings. Nearly everything related to the topic is a closely guarded secret, known only by a handful of elders in the brotherhood. Rumor has it though that the dwarves will use some arcane mining methods in order to increase the chances of dwarflings appearing inside of rare metals like gold. These oddities are usually substantially different from the standard dwarf, taking on some of the properties of the metal they form from. Golden dwarves, a favorite amongst the dwarven elite, tend to be softer, thinner and more magically talented. There are even some rumors of dwarfling eggs being used as part of the forging process in order to create metallic dwarves. If such things do exist and are not just fantasy stories told by bards looking to capture the interest of the common folk, then they have never seen the light of day.",

As such an elven lifespan is theoretically infinite given ideal conditions.Elves reach adulthood at 20 and have a median age of 300Appearance and BiologyElves are lithe androgynous humanoids with long and pointed ears as their most telling feature. Elves do not age in the traditional sense. Most humanoids start a slow decline once they reach adulthood, eventually becoming withered husks of their former selves. Elves become adults at about the same speed as humans, but when they grow old, they physically change based on things like their environment or their magical affinity. Forest hermits might eventually growing leaves and branches, stag horns or feathers. A wizard that specializes in cryomancy might turn a light shade of blue and grow cold to the touch. Changing in physical properties like these typically happen slowly over decades or even centuries.AgelessElves are unique among humanoids due to their seemingly infinite longevity and youthfulness. As such, they develop a very different perception of time and the world at large. Many details are often lost to the passage of time, but elves persist. While a generation of humans might pass every 20 years or so, a generation of elves often lasts over a century. As such they have a unique perspective on the rise and fall of empires, world level crises and the passage of time in general. Elves possess a unique form of wisdom that can either be used to aid other races, or it can cause them to become jaded as they see the same pattern of self destruction emerge multiple times amongst the humanoid societies they observe.Long life isn't all sunshine and rainbows. Elves can often develop a superiority complex; considering elves are usually the smartest or wisest person in any given room. Yearly celebrations such as birthdays are largely ignored. Elves making friends with non elves is a rarity, since they won't stick around long enough to matter anyway. Elves can often seem apathetic towards the plights of other humanoids, but their reactions have merely been tempered by experience.Because elven society moves much more slowly than other humanoids, many of their practices can seem archaic, time-consuming and inconvenient. They are often purposefully designed to be so in order to make them take more time and be more inconvenient to replicate for other races. \"See you again soon\" takes on an entirely different meaning as the elf's perception of time is likely wildly different that we, and what most non-elven creatures, think. They tend to be much more conservative than others, adhering to ancient traditions and worshiping less popular or older deities. Everybody is a kid at some point so they understand what it was like to some degree: What it is like to feel wonder in a world filled with the unknown. At some point people grow and the wonder and discovery of childhood is filled with responsibility and routine of adulthood. Elves eventually come to exist on some 3rd plateau of existence where they have eaten every food, vacationed in every country, saved the world, started a family, lost people they loved, turned to the dark side and were eventually redeemed and all the rest. Once you experience so much of what the world has to offer, once you have given so much of yourself to the world only to be forgotten, what is the meaning of your continued existence?ObsessionThe aforementioned appearance changes are merely an outward representation of decades, maybe even centuries of obsession. When traditional methods of acquiring meaning in one's life fail, elves have all the time in the world to dedicate to their projects. Spiteful elves may eventually have their conscious eroded to the point where the short-lived races are viewed as mice in their experiments, and are transformed into monsters. They might develop an entirely selfless desire to protect the natural world and view most any inhabitants that exploit it as a virus to be cured by any means necessary. Maybe at a young age they are exposed to a great evil and tirelessly work to exterminate it, and snuff out any reemergence for as long as they live.Turning people into monsters is abhorrent, and hunting demons is noble. Protecting nature is a lofty ideal, but usually most humanoids are only willing to go as far is needed to maintain their way of life: Appeasing the spirits for safety, enriching the soil for crops etc. So a single-minded dedication to nature could easily cause conflict once one too many trees are cut. These exceptionally long-lived elves that develop obsessions don't necessarily cause conflict, but depending on their obsession, they very easily could. Entire elven societies form around the adaptive obsessions, for better or worse.",

Tradition+2 history * Lore NumbersEternal are around 5' tall and weight around 100 lbsSmall eternals tend to be about half the height and a third of the weight.Despite their name, eternals are not immortal. They reach adulthood at 20 and tend to live to about 80.Appearance and BiologyEternals are androgynous fey with very thin limbs and a similar overall \"bipedal humanoid\" shape. They have protrusions from the sides of the head or the face that resemble feathers that can flutter to and fro for additional expressiveness. The \"default\" is usually quite plain with mainly white with secondary green colors, and gem-like structures that help focus their psychic powers. Damaging this removes their ability to communicate telepathically unless they physically touch someone.The appearance of others can vary considerably, with some borrowing features of their appearance from plants or animals. They are fans of the long and flowing fabrics of robes and dresses. Many are capable of manipulating plantlike parts of their body to grow in special shapes.An odd quirk to the eternal is that they are genderless at birth. It isn't until they start developing romantic feelings for someone close to them over a long period of time where they undergo a rapid transformation to accommodate for their partners preferences. They still stay the same general shape, but with more desirable secondary characteristics.\"For the Greater Good\"Most races are capable of empathy, but few hold it in as high a regard as eternals do. In self-contained groups, their collectivist ideals and cooperative nature lead to what some might consider a socialist utopian society. However eternal society is very fragmented, and the groups tend not to interact with each other. Groups rarely have more than 200 people in them.This does not mean that they are an insular people, just that it is very difficult for most to make the kinds of sacrifices that come naturally to eternals. While a human would readily accept no strings attached exorbitant wealth so they can indulge in the finer things of life, an eternal would question how this money was obtained. If people needed to suffer in order to produce this wealth, they would undoubtedly refuse it. Sustainability is of the utmost importance to eternals. Every action they take is an internal calculation where the desirable result is to lift everybody up. Even in personal relationships, squabbles are talked about amongst the community so grudges or trauma are worked through and \"cured\" before they balloon into major problems.Branching PathsAs part of the advanced calculus that goes on in the head of an eternal, sometimes they deem it necessary to leave their people for the greater good. These individuals are bound to have incredibly stressful lives, as they will constantly be surrounded and people that do not share their ideals. People that hoard wealth, subjugate others and hide their emotions frustrate eternals.Even with these hardships, they press on. They perform mental gymnastics to believe that one day all races can learn to be more like them, and they will be the ones to enact this change. They excel in any profession where their empathy and ideals can be put to good use such as diplomacy or law enforcement. In an adventuring party they lean towards supportive roles like healers.IntimacyEternals often struggle when mingling with other races. Many of the practices that they feel are commonplace between their own people are too intimate or unusual to generally apply to other races. Physical contact, sharing feelings, collaboration, mutual respect: these are the kinds of things that the eternal will find they give too much of, and others give too little of. This can make the transition difficult. This is even worse for eternals raised outside of their own society, who almost universally feel out of place. Eternals in an abusive household will invariably end up menaces.These things can complicate romantic relationships. Eternal require a deep, intimate connection with someone that can only be obtained through years of interactions. As such it is very common for them to be in relationships with childhood friends, even those outside of their race.The Eternal OneThe Eternal One is a collective conscience stored inside of something of significance, like a gem, or a tree. It is of great importance to the eternals since it holds the memories of their people, and is the central focus of rituals disposing of the crystalized memories of the dead. Each settlement has one, and it typically has a guardian that will consult it during times of great distress. Proclamations made by The Eternal One may as well be decrees from a god with how much severity and seriousness they are treated with. It is through these proclamations that eternals most commonly find themselves separating from their kin.",

Fallen typically appear as they did in adulthood for 50 years before passing.ExaltedThis race comes in 2 different forms, the more common is the exalted. These are creatures born from a mortal humanoid and a heavenly god. Exalted children usually only know one of their parents personally. Their heavenly parent usually only takes a passing interest in their mortal children, unless they are particularly devoted followers or they accrue a great deal of influence.Exalted that do know of their divine heritage often go to great lengths to impress their deific parent. The silence they experience is painful, but the satisfaction when they are finally acknowledged is immeasurable. Exalted can often feel great pressure to live in ways that reflect an unflinching moral compass. People will often put them on pedestals as the chosen ones of their god: A birthright that does not correspond with the personal thoughts and feelings of the exalted can create a lot of cognitive dissonance. Unhappy exalted tend to break away from their roots in very dramatic and drastic fashions.FallenThe less common form is the fallen. These were creatures that passed away and through their deeds in life were granted access to the heavens in the afterlife. At one point or another though, they broke rules dealing with fiends, sneaking people into the heavens or some other particularly heinous act. As punishment, they are forced to drink from the river styx, forgetting much of their past selves. Then they are banished to the mortal realm, often living hallow lives, but never understanding where that feeling comes from.The touch of divinity never truly leaves them, however. Essentially reborn as adults, Fallen are often drawn to doing the same types of righteous things they did in life to earn their place among the greats. Fragments of memories from their previous lives remain, and what they remember can drastically change their outlook. Sometimes they can create hope that one day they may return, but in others, it only creates spite for the harshest punishment imaginable.Appearance and BiologyThe exalted closely resemble the race of their mortal parent, but with bonus shinyness. They might have a metallic sheen to their hair, eyes that glow a solid gold, cracks along their body filled with gold or other such visually distinct changes. Universally they all have halos of some kind.Fallen resemble the appearance they had in life, but often with the color drained from them, supplemented by black. Their skin tends towards a gray porcelain, their hair, black. If they have wings, they will often have both black and white feathers.Exalted can reproduce freely with mortals, but without any attention from their deific parent, the children are born as their partners race. Fallen follow the same rules, but have no chance of ever created another of their kind.Exalted vs FallenBy their natures, fallen and exalted all tend to be first generation celestials, with the celestial blood diluting with each generation. As such, encounters between exalted and fallen tend to be uncommon. They tend to have mixed feelings about each other.For the exalted, they feel a mixture of pity and envy. Pity that the fallen have no place in the heavens and envy that they are unshackles from their heavenly duties. Oftentimes they will mistreat the fallen, giving them a \"holier than thou\" attitude. Others that feel they have failed their divine parents will reach out to the fallen and find a kinship that only someone abandoned by the gods can truly understand.For the fallen, exalted represent a possible connection to the divine. This presents an opportunity for redemption, so fallen are typically a lot more excited to find exalted than the other way around. Unfortunately, many will end up disappointed; Either by the lack of enthusiasm, or the lack of connection the exalted has with the divine. Being mistreated by the exalted can make fallen feel even more jaded than they were before about the gods and how they treat mortals.",

They can grow small plants on their bodies such as flowers and vines. Some even have leafy hair.They have colors that match the natural world around them. If fairies stay in a new location for several months, their colors change to better blend in. This means that fairies that live in cold environments will likely have lighter tones with more blue, while forest-dwelling fairies will likely favor green and brown. Fairies will naturally change with the seasons as well, causing their leafy hair to be a vibrant green in the spring/summer, and brown or red in the fall.Fairies naturally create a powder commonly referred to as \"fairy dust\" that has a wide variety of applications depending on what the fairy is adapted to. It can help with tracking, decoration and even combat. Used as fuel, it can produce fairy fire, which burns until put out and comes in a wide variety of colors.We do a lil' TrollingFey creatures are well known for being mischievous, and fairies are no exception. Their flight, small size and propensity for pranks make them prototypical as far as the trickster fey archetype is concerned. They will snatch things from windowsills, use their fairy dust to mess up paintings or paint jobs and use their small size and huge eyes to appear innocent and get out of trouble.Most fairies don't stray too far from mischievous. Even their evil plots are usually centered around something minor and silly like ruining someones vegetables with their guerrilla gardening. As such, its usually difficult to take a fairy seriously, even if they are causing serious harm. On the opposite side, their good deeds also tend to not be anything spectacular, like helping a tipped over turtle or battling against a beehive. Fairies tend to be unconcerned with the world at large and its problems, or the long term consequences of their actions. They may end up the saviors of the world joining along some adventuring party, but they were just in it because they like giving the party's beast companion treats and the bard was cute. They may also end up as lackeys in some grandiose plot to take over the world because they were convinced it was gonna be some super awesome prank.Great FairiesIn general, fairies don't live in settlements with other humanoids. They live in the wilderness amongst animals, plants and other fey in little alcoves and clearings protected by a great fairy. Great fairies are massive in size and serve as the guardians to portals to the realm of the fey: the feywilds. These portals are usually decorated pools of shimmering water water decorated with all manner of colorful plants, toadstools and rocks. Great fairies typically reside directly inside this portal, partially submerged so they can interact with creatures in a manner that's at least a little closer to face to face. They can handily deactivate the portal, making interacting with the great fairy a necessary part of using the portal. They usually serve to protect any who wish to travel to and fro between the realms. They also serve as something of a border patrol, keeping the worst from both sides away from the portal. Great fairies are powerful magical creatures that few are willing to attack all on their own. Such plans are made all the more difficult by the entourage of allies they usually gather. Great fairies will naturally accrue a lot of followers and may even be inclined to create organizations around finding and protecting these portals. Because these locations are well protected and serve as a natural gathering spot for travelers, these are where the fairy population is its most dense. Many don't directly serve the great fairy, but are willing to perform menial tasks like sending messages and guiding people through the wilds. Sometimes begrudgingly, sometimes happily, seeing it as an opportunity to mess with humanoids less familiar with the poisonous mushrooms and dangerous sleepy monsters of the natural world.",

They love feeling the wind blowing in their hair so they usually will go to great lengths to maintain a large head of hair. Air geniekin are the lightest of the bunch, rarely breaking 120 lbs for even the largest of them.Fire geniekin have red and orange skin tones, and hair that resembles fire blazing atop their heads. Male geniekin will also have facial hair with the same properties. They have a much higher body temperature than most humanoids, making them very popular in the winter.Water geniekin skin tones vary between blue and green, depending on whether they prefer salt or freshwater. Just like with firekin, their hair can also mimic their element. It looks as though it is in a constant state of flow. Most are amphibious, capable of living comfortably in land or sea.Earth geniekin are typically gray, brown, black or somewhere in between. Instead of hair, some grow crystalline structures on their head that they can mold to resemble hair. It lacks the same softness and malleability, but makes up for it with shinyness. Earthkin are the heaviest of the bunch. Their density causes them to be upwards of 200lbs.The \"elemental-ness\" of a geniekin can vary greatly. With some being closer to humans, and others that are made of stone for example.Like a Genie!Geniekin are all the byproduct of genie wishes. One way or another, all of the humanoids generated through genie magic are geniekin. Wish for an army? Geniekin soldiers. Wish for a son? Geniekin. An entire planet complete with servants? Geniekin servants. Particularly large and grandiose wishes that people have made in the past have made it so the population of geniekin is steady beyond first generation wish creations.Created by magic, geniekin often feel drawn to studying magic in some way, shape or form. It makes them feel as though they are getting closer to finding the origin of their species. Many geniekin are still born with a spark of that genie's magic that created them all those years, perhaps even generations ago. All they need to do is speak \"I wish\" and their genie powers work to shape the reality to their liking…albeit in less impressive and more subtle ways. It's more like gently steering reality in a desired direction than shaping it.AvatarGeniekin are the creators of the 4 bending styles. They are often drawn to each other by their natural affinity for such magic. There are many settlements that started up as a result of several earth benders or water benders meeting up and starting a school to teach. The ability to bend their respective element is the primary uniting and binding force behind geniekin society. The most highly regarded individuals among geniekin are the bending masters.Benders will sometimes be given a final task by their masters to locate what they call \"elemental wells.\" These are places that house large amounts of energy as a result of natural formations. Places like volcanoes or storms or tornadoes are common locations. These locations establish a much deeper connection between the bender and their element, and usually marks them as a master.Legend has it that when the world falls into chaos, there will be someone who is capable of mastering all 4 elements, drawing power from 4 different elemental wells, and using it to bring balance to the world.",

They have large mouths, often with sharp teeth that fall out and regrow frequently. Even considering their oversized head, their ears are enormous, sometimes growing to be comically large. Some can even be a little on the fuzzy side, with fluffy ears closer to that of an animal, or a tail with a tuft of fur at the end of it.Goblins are lazy, and tend to present themselves in a candid manner without a lot of attention to their physical appearance. This typically means they wear styles that require the smallest amount of maintenance: bald heads, no makeup, wearing the same things they wore as a kid, never changing out of their armor. Goblin engineers may just wear overalls and nothing else because its all it takes to get the job done. Goblins also tend to be less concerned with cleanliness than other races. If it isn't required, then its pretty low on the priority list.Mine!A goblins short life span and dubious morals combined with their ravenous hunger and general laziness all combine to create a race that rarely has anything to show for their existence. While other races create cities and monuments, goblins prefer to move into wherever is mostly convenient. Goblins will treat the ruins of an ancient city as though they had always lived there, and will make up stories for how they made things. They will invade small towns to kick out their current inhabitants without giving much thought to the consequences when the survivors come to back to take their town backed by the local government. This lack of foresight, or perhaps lack of caring for the consequences of their actions contributes to the shortness of the goblin's lifespan.An actual city with tens of thousands of people or more started up and run by goblins is completely unheard of. Most goblin settlements tend to crumple under their own weight once they reach a certain size. Or they get too big for their britches and anger the wrong adventuring party, local rich person or monster, resulting in a hard reset in a new place.LeechesGoblin tendencies make them terrible at governance, but that doesn't make them completely incompatible with \"civilized\" society. Small enclaves of goblins will often be a part of any city they aren't outright banned from. Whether their old family died, they were abandoned at a young age, or they fantasize about fancy living, goblins frequently find themselves wandering into towns with nothing but the clothes on their back and a dream of the good life. Alas, the talents they have accrued living out in the wilderness do little to help them live honest lives, and the city is hardly kinder than the outside. City goblins tend towards petty crime or sex work in order to make ends meet. As such, even the upstanding goblin citizens have a mighty uphill battle against the stereotypes of goblin raiders that haunt peoples dreams and the goblin whores that attend to their carnal desires.Their lack of experience with working in general makes them unreliable workers at best. Savvy employers often exploit young goblins, knowing they're going to burn out quick anyway. Might as well get the value while you can. The deception works both ways as the goblins are always finding ways to slip goods they're supposed to sell into their pockets, or take a little bit of money from the register when nobody is looking.Superior GeneticsWhile the picture people paint of goblins is typically negative, they still manage to maintain a steady(ish) population and a consistent place in peoples minds. They bring a certain energy to everything they do that is unlike most other races. Extreme optimism, lack of expertise combined with a general trust of whoever feeds them makes goblins excellent companions for maintaining morale. Due to their short-sightedness, every victory is worth celebrating and every plan with a huge payout is a banger idea. Goblins never settle with success. When they hit the jackpot they keep rolling. When they lose it all, they say double or nothin'. Every defeat they survive is a new opportunity.Goblins make up for their numerous negative traits with their ability to learn things quickly, and with novel approaches. Engineer is basically synonymous with inventor for goblins, as they refuse to use the principles they are educated on for practical purposes, always forging their own path. If it isn't a spell and it explodes, it was probably a goblin that made it.Goblins are also nearly as fond of race mixing as humans. It'd be more accurate to say they are just fond of breeding, but they aren't picky with partners. They have the hardware to accommodate for larger races, and they are happy to take good genes when they find them. Combined with their short lifespans, goblins can quickly morph to physically resemble whatever other race is most dense within a few generations.",

When created they usually form biologically in early adulthood.Appearance and biologyHellion are roughly human shaped, but can come in many different forms. Many have spaded or forked tails they can use to grab objects. Some have vestigial wings. The most common features are a Hellion's Horns on their head. They come in all different shapes and sizes: Long curved horns like a ram, short pointed horns, multiple pairs of horns, only a single horn.They often superficially resemble the race they were before their fiendish transformation with pointed elf ears or orcish tusks, but that’s where the similarities typically end. Hellion can have wildly different skin colors from crimson red to a grayish blue. Some of them even have furry digitigrade lower halves with cloven hooves.Hellion that try to mesh well into society will dress in whatever the locals wear. As a result of how they are created, many take the opportunity to devote themselves to Brazzeria and wear her ceremonial garb. Though the stereotypical freshly created hellion will likely get piercings, decorate their horns in jewelry and wear indecent clothing just to be contrarian.Open your HeartHellion are created by a Brazzerian purification ritual used on demons that were once mortal. Many fiends are beyond redemption, but those that aren't can be exposed to kindness, care and respect to slowly restore their humanity. Brazerrian priests and priestesses are able to read the hearts to fiends to tell whether they are closed or open, representing their receptiveness to healing the fiendish corruption. Over time they can (usually) be exposed to enough kindness to eventually open their heart and begin the transformation.Freshly transformed hellions have no memories of their previous life before being a fiend, but they do vividly remember what happened during their time as a fiend: All of the suffering they caused, all the lives they’ve taken and all of the kindness they were treated with in order to regain their humanity. After some rehabilitation, they are given a choice to join the cause or return back to society.RacismUnfortunately for hellion, there are scars caused by fiends all over the world. Many people do not understand the intricacies of fiendish creation, or the humanity restoration the hellion undergo. As such, newly created hellion that do not stay under the protective wings of Brazzeria can often be in for a rough time. Small communities of hellion can often be found on the fringes of places where there is a great deal of Brazzerian influence.The racism can go both ways; providing hardship as well as opportunity. Hellion will often find themselves getting approached by unsavory individuals looking for a new hire in their organized crime ring. They will also find it difficult to shake off the \"sex demon\" stereotype perpetuated by the prolific and every present succubi/twinkubi. It does serve them well when finding dates or getting jobs at brothels at least.",

They have large jaws with an underbite in order to accommodate for their tusks. They also tend to have short pointed ears and either green or gray skin. Some orcs that live in desert regions can get a reddish hue to their skin. Orcs are much larger than most humanoids, typically being taller and having a much higher muscle density. Even the females share this quality.Orcs are very generous with the beatings they give their body, even when it comes to fashion. They get body and face tattoos, piercings all over and they use scars to trace patterns in their flesh. They commonly dress themselves in furs and leathers, or whatever handy material they can harvest from the creatures they hunt: There's no easier way to show off your greatest kill than to wear in on your sleeve. Literally.BarbarismNo two words fit well together quite like orc barbarian. The prototypical barbarian lives only by killing other creatures. Depending on how annoying their neighbors are, this could even mean other humanoids. Individual orcs tend to keep to themselves. It is only when large groups of orcs gather together where they start becoming a problem for anything around them. It isn't uncommon for a charismatic leader to arise among tribes and unify a few hundred (or more). Then, emboldened by their numbers, they try to take over surrounding towns.More often than not, these types of battles happen between orcs and other orcs. Orcs will have long and drawn out histories of their clan and the surrounding ones, with shaky alliances and even shakier reasons for breaking them. The call for glory in battle is often answered with an almost religious zeal.It isn't all blood in guts within the walls of orc villages. They take great interest in animals; and not just to eat them! They make excellent beast tamers and in general are talented when it comes to the druidic arts. Even the barbarians have animal spirits they use to guide their bestial fighting styles. Orcs are surprisingly mindful when it comes to maintaining a natural equilibrium in their local ecosystem. Unfortunately, they don't share the same degree of respect for places they consider far from home.Friend or Foe?Because of their proclivity for violence, orcs are near universally feared and avoided unless necessary. Orc culture can be very intimidating to outsiders who are accustomed to less violence. So their questions become \"can I trust an orc?\" or \"are orcs dangerous?\" This typically depends on the situation. If you hear the war horns, most definitely. But most situations aren’t nearly as cut and dry. Travelling along the road and seeing a half dozen group eyeing your party might make a merchant sweat a little. Much to the dismay of traveling merchants, they will likely end up in many situations with orcs where they are forced to choose between their goods or their life. Orcs are bullies that use the threat of violence as leverage in order to get what they want. Unfortunately for orcs, they are also prone to misdirection. Convince them that there is a much more lucrative option and they might spare you and your goods.OutsidersOrcs that don't align with a particular tribe tend to be drifters, hopping into whatever group their particular talents and morals are well suited for. Common entries are mercenary groups, organized crime and state militaries. Most people tend to view orcs with the same kind of wariness one affords a natural predator; respect, but stay cautious. This serves them well when they want to rise through the ranks of a military, but does little to aid in friendly relations with others. Rarely does a town have a neighborhood filled primarily with orcs, but they tend to pepper any town with more than a few thousands people.Separated from traditional orc culture, orcs can find great success with studies of magic and the arts just like most other people, but they have a bit of an uphill battle getting past stereotypes,",

The natural ebb and flow of the world caused resources like food to grow scarce. Many solutions were tried and failed but one mad scientist saw the solution that nobody else could: Half resource consumption by shrinking everyone down to half size.He spent his entire life being looked down upon, and now it was going to be his turn. He created a chemical compound he called shortstackium that, even in small doses, could cause people to shrink in size significantly. He found clever ways to get this substance into the food and water supply. He put trace amounts into his potions that he sold to adventurers.It was very fast acting, causing people to shrink by the time they awoke the next day. Due to its complexity and strangeness, it took a few weeks to identify the problem and another month to eliminate most of its circulation, getting its creator thrown in jail in the process. His solution was quite effective, but it completely transformed people unwillingly, often with strange side effects. No alchemist has ever managed to figure out how to reverse the effects, and the effects are passed down through children. Appearance and BiologyBecause shorstackium was most effective on humans, the typical pint most closely resembles humans, but pints resembling other races also exist. A great deal of genetic mutation happened as a result of initial incident. This has caused all kinds of changes to the pints.Some common",

They tried to kill it after it had consumed someone close to them, but poly only multiply when killed after absorbing a creature. Their death triggers a reaction where they split into two unintelligent amorphous blobs that seek creatures to consume. Since this event, they have slowly spread. Some non-poly use these slime creatures as a method to continue their life after suffering health complications, other people fear their hunger for intelligent life, but most know nothing about the origin of poly.Appearance and BiologyPoly share the general shape of the person they consumed. While poly are somewhat amorphous, this is their \"true form\" that they do not deviate from too much. As oozes, they are often viscous and jello-like, coming in a variety of colors. Pressing your finger to their skin, it would bend, but it would be difficult to break. They are generally at least semi-transparent.Despite having the ability to remove imperfections, such as scars, missing teeth, slices of ear missing, poly keep these qualities. Instead the alterations they make usually add completely new features, like antennae, horns or tattoos.Poly generally have \"barbie bod\" smoothing over their intimate parts, and can get away with not wearing any clothing, but many still do. When they do wear clothing, they always choose things that are exceptionally elastic to accommodate for their stretching formsDespite having little in common with humanoids in terms of their biology, they will usually still try to mimic how creatures hold things with fingers and eat with their mouths. It can still be a bit awkward watching their food slowly dissolve in their goo (one reason why they like to wear clothing).Memories of the PastWhile it is clear that a poly loses its soul when it dies and splits, all poly are essentially clones of their \"parents\" combined with some other creature unfortunate enough to be eaten. Some aspects of their predecessors' consciousness seep into their own. As such, poly often have unusual senses of self. Many of their thoughts are dominated by the memories and feelings of the creature they consumed. While they rest, their dreams are often filled with memories of their previous life. Consuming creatures with particularly strong convictions can lead to the poly working to achieve similar goals. Some poly learn more about their origin and feel guilt towards what must have happened in order for them to exist. Other poly don't understand why they have a head filled with the memories of an outsider, and do everything they can to avoid things that trigger these alien memories.",

It's also no substitute for interacting with them in person. Minor Features Toy SpeechWhile in miniature form, you gain the ability to speak to other inanimate toys.

Once you choose what form you can take, it cannot be changed without significant physical augmentation. As a standard action you can transform into or back from this alternate form. You function as a masterwork tool for any creature using you, giving them a +2 bonus, or +4 if you are trained in the skill (treated as assisting). You could also transform into other objects such as a pogo stick (increase jump height to movespeed) or a bike (increase speed to 50).While in this form, you can only perform your intended purpose, move or transform back. * Minor Wind UpYou have a mechanism that allows you to perform very high jumps by storing kinetic energy. \"Winding up\" requires 3 standard actions.

Their life is inherently tied to another, and they live as long as their bonded siblingMagic of LifeAs animated toys, poplin cannot reproduce, nor can they be created consistently. Instead there is a mysterious force that animates the toys of children experiencing hardship. Wizards debate the origin, but the transformation is obviously magical in origin, so its probably another powerful anonymous mage. Either way, these creatures come into being with the same mentality as the young children that create them: that of a curious ignorant creature with a generally positive outlook on the world, especially their bonded sibling, whom they immediately feel kinship towards.AppearancePoplins often have strange appearances that are facsimiles of humanoid creatures. Common ones are plushies and action figures. As such they often have seems and stitches, very visible joints, shiny, smooth or fluffy surfaces. They are often able to move in unnatural ways, such as turning their limbs all the way around or turning inside out to change their appearance; toys are creative. Usually poplin are afforded a bit more mobility than most other toys and plushies, with bending fingers and flapping lips to allow for fine manipulation and speech.Poplin generally stay about the same in appearance as they age from when they are magically willed into existence unless they go out of their way to replace parts of themselves. During old age, they start to literally fall apart as their sibling deteriorates. Their colors fade, seams pop and joints creak.Sibling SquabblesThe way that poplin view their bonded sibling is just that, as though they were siblings. There generally a great degree closeness between a poplin and their sibling. They often play together, help each other out, fight over who gets the last cookie etc.Childhood is usually the easy part, as the poplins dependence on their sibling doesn't matter as much for carefree children with a lot of free time. Poplin often find it difficult to get out of the naïve mindset of a child. So once their sibling becomes an adult, they can often become less important. Suddenly all of those sleepovers and woodland adventures are replaced by the reality and responsibility of adulthood. Poplin can find it difficult coming to terms with living apart from their bonded sibling, often being seen as the toys they resemble. Nothing is more crushing than hearing something like \"Oh that's just a toy I used to play with as a kid.\" From their sibling. Those that adjust well settle for frequent family gatherings, settling as coworkers or adventurers.Poplin separated from their sibling, young or old, are incomplete.

The shadow realm is a black mostly featureless void with a tangible floor, but not much else. You can bring in any number of creatures, or any amount of objects so long as it can be brought in within 1 round.This dimension can only exist as long as you are inside of it and alive. If you leave, are banished or die, the contents of the dimension are immediately ejected to the same point you entered from.Shadow Friend (Su)[recharge] [scrying]You can animate your shadow and have it walk around. You can see and hear through your shadow. Your shadow can move anywhere as long as there is a continuous stream of dim light or darkness connecting you and your shadow. As a shadow, you must move along a continuous surface at all times. If 2 surfaces are not connected, you cannot move between them. You can easily move along walls or ceilings however.While animating your shadow, a tether connects you that is significantly darker than even complete darkness, visible to creatures with night vision or darkvision. If the shadow or the tether is attacked, or if the shadow/tether is exposed to bright light, shadow friend immediately ends.Shade Magic (Su)You have a hover speed of 30 ft.Insubstantial (Su)[mana burn]As a FRA, you can [mana burn] 1 in order to pass through a surface no thicker than 1 ft.

These two colors can form unique patterns on the skin, much like how animal fur patterns exist. Their eyes and hair tend to be more vibrant colors, contrasting their dull skin. They grow hair on their heads much faster than other races, forcing them to get frequent haircuts. Thanks to their magical abilities, their hair can appear even longer than it is. They also inscribe tattoos on their skin for added customization.Shades possess the usual sex organs present in most humanoids, but their innate magical abilities gives them the ability to hide most features on their skin to give themselves \"barbie bod,\" making their body smooth and featureless. As such, some opt to not even wear clothing. Most do wear clothing, and they prefer things that show off their skin and are frilly like dresses and veils.Shadow CursedThere exists a land in Nick Nacks considered uninhabitable by most known as the Shadow-Cursed lands. These islands are plagued with eternal darkness as a result of a curse placed upon them by the vampiric overlords that desired more suitable living conditions. As such, all kinds of undead spawn inside of this area. The souls of heroes that tried to cleanse this land serve as ammunition for all of the necromantic research that happens within.Many years ago, an enclave of goblins was forced to flee by sea and was chased to one of these shadow-cursed islands. The goblins thought they had lost their pursuers, but the adventurers were merely unwilling to follow, having heard the rumors of the treacherous environments that often lie within. The adventurers claimed their gold for a job well done, and the goblins were forgotten.Snap back to the present day where the shadow-cursed islands have become a much greater focus of adventuring parties and that same island was explored. Much to their surprise, the adventurers found creatures settling in these lands that weren't interested in stealing their souls. More and more sightings of this magical small race with strange dexterous hair were noted all around the world. As scholars began compiling data about these Shades as they called themselves, they were able to trace their history back to that group of goblins all those years ago. Shades have since become the envoys between the shadow-cursed isles and the rest of the world, working as guides and teachers.Twilight PrincessAside from the physical changes the goblins experienced, they also went through many cultural shifts. They learned a new language that they used to read records etched into the abandoned stony ruins they initially called home and to communicate with the locals. Through this learning, one of their leaders was able to befriend a local witch, and received some magical boons in return. Over time the relationship between the goblins and this witch deepened. The goblins would happily attend to her needs, acquiring rare materials, scouting out new islands to set up bases and dispatching pests. Soon enough she was referred to as the twilight princess and highly revered by all.After many generations of goblins living in the shadow cursed lands and receiving these magical boons, they stopped being goblins after a certain point. Their skin and hair had completely changed colors to more closely resemble their princess. Their relationship with the twilight princess deepened their magical capabilities. The more treacherous environment and dependence on the princess had changed their culture. One day without warning, the twilight princess disappeared, leaving behind only an infant that closely resembled her and a letter to her people, who she referred to as her little shades. The name stuck and since then, the twilight princess has been treated as royalty. She continues to guide the shades through life in the shadow cursed lands.",

They feel a certain kinship towards the fungus and form a symbiotic relationship with it. The mushrooms are most common on their head, but they can grow all over: Its only a matter of where they groom that decides where they grow. In order to not be seen as monsters, most shroomkin tend to keep most of their body clean. Another telling feature is that shroomkin never have white scaleras, always favoring darker and duller colors.Because shroomkin easily blend together with other races, they come in a wide variety of colors. The type of mushrooms they grow on their skin can also change very quickly due over a few generations. Certain mixes with shroomkin can create wildly different mushroom flavors from a hellion's spicy shroom to a watery geniekin's minty shroom.BiologyJust like the mushroom itself, there's a lot more happening under the hood with shroomkin and their relationship to fungus. They constantly maintain a thin layer of mucous, making their skin always well-moisturized and slick to the touch. Shroomkin typically use this poisonous excretion as a method to mess with people, but can be used to remedy a great deal of situations, provided they can make contact to deliver it.An interesting quirk to shroomkin biology is that when they conceive, instead of gestating over a long period of time, they grow a special mushroom (cluster?) on the exterior of their body that their child(ren) will eventually sprout from over the short period of a few weeks. Shroomkin babies are very small when compared to races of similar sizes, but they are a lot more mobile, capable of crawling, clinging and even climbing after only a few hours. This accelerated physical development continues until they reach adulthood, but their mental lags behind a few years by comparison, leading most \"adult\" shroomkin to more closely resemble teenagers in how they act. Shroomkin males paired with other races produce offspring of the mother's race.GoomshroomThere is a specific type of fungus that only grows in areas blessed by the persistent drizzle of a goo dragon. With the shape and patterns of a mushroom and the colors and antennae of the goo dragon, the goomshroom is a treasured item that is always treated with great care. These sentient fungi live several times longer than the shroomkin and usually serve the role of a \"village elder\" who will pass down stories from generation to generation and be their voice of wisdom.Shroomkin will sometimes call upon the goo dragon during times of great crises. There is no guarantee they will come, but the good nature of the goo dragon means it will usually answer the call and come to their aid. Other groups of shroomkin have a very close relationships with the goo dragons and they serve as the settlement's protector.Blessing of the ShroomletteThe Shroomlette is the shroomkin god of happiness, rest and fertility. One of the few gods that exists in the realm of mortals. She resides in a garden filled with all kinds of oddities that rests on the clouds above a mushroom forest. There she resides, forever resting in a shiny cradle, waiting to be tucked in by a visitor. The Garden is commonly used as a place of mediation since all forms of violence are forbidden within the domain of the Shroomlette.Occasionally when couples are unable to conceive or sometimes for more mysterious reasons, people will receive a blessing from The Shroomlette. A stork will deliver a baby shroomkin girl directly to their abode with mysterious origins. Many see this as a blessing, but others who aren't happy about their newfound responsibility see it as a burden, and do everything they can to get rid of it. Those that don't treat the child with love and care incur the wrath of the Shroomlette. With poor enough treatment, she may even curse them to be an adult trapped inside of a babies body for a time to experience the some of the anguish they put the child through.",

Taking 20 When not under duress, and with a lot of time on your hands, you can automatically achieve the result of rolling a 20. It takes 20 times as long as the task would normally take. It is also assumed that during this time, you fail several times, making it ill-suited for a situations where there are consequences on a fail (such as smashing a wall or deactivating an explosive). Group Skill Checks In certain circumstances, creatures may want to work together perform the same task. If it is something that can tangibly benefit from group effort (pushing over a large boulder, creating a spell etc.), use the bonus of the creature with the highest modifier, then get +1 for each assisting creature and +2 for each assistant creature that is proficient in the task at hand. In other circumstances, you may want to use skills as a group when you need to, even if it less than optimal, such as group stealth with a clumsy heavy armor user. In such scenarios, you use the bonus of the weakest link as though everybody were assisting them. Gambits Using a rule system inherently poses limitations on the actions that a player can take. The idea of gambits is to let players take their cool ideas and let them play out despite the games mechanics. If your player wants to do something that isn't necessarily covered by the rules (or only vaguely), then it counts as a gambit. The intention behind gambits is to create situations that have incredibly high risk and high reward. Before performing a gambit, the player tosses out a few ideas on how they plan to perform the action and the GM makes suggestions and/or adjustments based on circumstance. The GM should make it clear to the player what their roundabout odds are for completing a given gambit. Benefits for performing a gambit can include things like not taking fall damage with a plunging attack, gaining extra movement by swinging on things through danger or surviving otherwise deadly circumstances. Drawbacks for failing when attempting a gambit can include things like being CC'd, losing poise, losing hp or having their actions interrupted and made impossible. In extreme cases if players do something very silly, like jumping up cliffs or battling forces of nature, they may accumulate afflictions, or other long lasting debuffs.",

The distance you jump is equal to your acrobatics roll in feet, or half that in height. This still requires a swift action to perform.

An ancient and powerful pact is in place that prevents the gods from seizing mortals as puppets to enact their will, and forces them to figure out more subtle and indirect means of acquiring what they want. This same pact makes them immune to conventional weapons. Gods have so much mana flowing through them that no singular person is close to powerful enough to even scratch them. This same mana allows them to perform incredible feats, often referred to as miracles.&#x20; Gods are free to walk amongst mortals only sparingly, as doing so requires a great deal of mana. As such they usually prefer only to appear in their Deific Aspects, which only allow them to exert a fraction of their power, and appear as a translucent spectral version of themselves. They can also appear as a mortal, unable to exert any of their usual deific powers, and usually having a hard time gathering the attention of mortals. They also use other indirect means, such as using their followers as vessels, projecting only their voice or having their messages appear in writing via ink or blood. Gods are not all-knowing, nor are they all-powerful. They have the ability to focus their attention on many places at once, with much greater detail in places where their followers exist. They hear and answer prayers while doing other things. Their ability to multi-task and process information is beyond comprehension. Certain types of things may draw their focus, such as hearing a prayer related to a matter that interests them, or a ritual in their honor conducted by one of their favorite disciples, or an enemy defacing their places of worship. Gods must carefully consider what they focus their attention on, and what they do. Their existence may seem immutable, but the countless gods lost to time suggest otherwise. They must satisfy the desires of mortals, lest they lose their source of power. As such, gods tend to only give boons to the dedicated, and only make appearances amongst mortals if it can be flashy and garner a lot of attention.

Pact Basics Pacts, like written contracts in real life, are methods of binding 2 parties together to persuade some time of cooperation or exchange. It usually involves exchanging goods, services, information or boons. Typically pacts are formed when someone desires something, but the other doesn't want to grant this desire for free. Both parties mediate until a satisfactory transaction is agreed upon. Then the 2 parties must decide on a punishment for the other should they not fulfill their end of the bargain. Again, the 2 parties come to an agreement on what the other desires. Finally, some type of gesture is taken to finalize the deal, such as shaking hands, returning a bow or signing a contract. Some creatures may take issue with the order in which the parties perform their end of the bargain, but it is inevitably up to the creature with the power to make the pact what order things happen in. Legally Binding&#x20; Pacts, unlike written contracts in real life, cannot be broken without evading consequence. Pacts are made with magic that does not ask for mediation or a jury. Disobeying the contract immediately afflicts the creature with whatever the punishment is. Any kind of agreement must be within the means of the creature to perform.&#x20; In the event where someone is unable to hold up their end of the bargain, or does so in a way that is not in accordance with the deal, they are afflicted with punishment immediately. You cannot also say \"I will grant you anything you wish\" without the ability to grant wishes.&#x20; Punishments must also be within the means of both parties. You cannot just say \"if you don't pet this dog 10 times then you burst into flames and die\" without being able to use some type of fire magic.

The entire Underworld is shaped around this mystical river. The liquid that flows through it changes based on the region of the Underworld. Pure in Elysium, lava in Asphodel and a crimson blood-like liquid in most other places. Exposure to the waters of the Styx has a variety of effects that depend on circumstances. Creatures who have lived exceptionally long lives are particularly resistant to the effects of the Styx while younger creatures are wiped clean very quickly.

But when he does answer prayers, they are typically in unexpected ways, and tend to be useful in ways other than providing advice. This could mean the place you are looking for suddenly explodes, the handsome fellow you were interested in talking to reveals they are a homosexual, or a frog will lead the way. In any such case, the advice/assistance comes in a much more dramatic and roundabout way. {% endhint %} Boons T1: Frog Shape (Su) \\[poly, true]\\ As a standard action you can assume the form of a tiny frog. You can transform back as a free action. Gain the following qualities… * | Mad Hops | Increase the distance the jump action brings you by 10 ft. | | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | | Tongue | Make combat maneuvers to drag at 30 ft range without penalty. | | Smol | Decrease size to tiny. Decrease reach to 0. | | Speed | Gain a swim speed. | T2: Born Again Believer (Su)\\ You can innately cast reincarnate 1/day. When you cast reincarnate, you gain access to a random innate technique that you can use once. While you have this technique, you lose access to reincarnation. After you expend the technique, you regain access to reincarnation. See chart below for determining what technique you gain. Using this technique as it is intended, AKA, not using it just to cycle to a new one, gives you 100 GBP. You cannot use this to farm GBP passively during down time. Up to DM interpretation what qualifies as \"intended use.\" Usually it involves using the technique in combat, or if a utility effect, in an apt scenario, such as using sending to communicate with a random person you met today with a cryptic message. T3: Forbidden Knowledge\\ You can expend a use of prayer in order to find out forbidden lore concerning a creature you can see. Choose a random creature within 30 ft of you and then roll serendipity. The higher the roll, the more pertinent the information. This knowledge is always presented in a numerical format such as \"2 kings killed\" for important/secret high roll info or \"0 dogs pet\" for low impact knowledge. Believer Chart When you truly believe, you are rewarded. Roll on this chart to see what technique tree, then roll d6 until you get a technique level you have access to. Then roll another dice in a similar method to determine what technique in that tier (something like a d10 should usually suffice). Ex. I roll 12 and get Cataclysm. Then I roll d6 and get 6, but I'm only level 5 and don't have access to tier 6 techniques. I roll d6 again and get a 1. I roll d8 and get a 1, giving me access to the 5G technique.

But there are locations where life is at its most dense that are considered sacred, like lush rain forests, coral reefs and the valleys between forested mountains.&#x20; Many see Mother Earth as a benevolent force, but she is primarily an entity that seeks balance between sentient creatures and the rest of the world. Many great tragedies have happened to people in the past when mankind overstepped its boundaries: Floods, earthquakes and storms the likes of which the world is better off never seeing again. These stories and their lessons are passed down through those studying under the druidic arts so that way such tragedies can be prevented from happening again. She is often depicted as a resting land mass, the bends of her shoulders, knees and hips creating mountains. While out and about, she is humanoid in shape, thought she appears to be entirely composed of lush green vegetation. Pano Boons T1: Friend of the Forest (Su)\\ You can expend a use of prayer to pacify a beast or plant creature.

(1=100, 2=400, 3=900...12=14,400) * Proficiency in planes. * The creature's name before it transformed. With all of the above ingredients, you can draw the magic circles required, power it, and initiate the ritual. The person in charge of performing the ritual rolls a DC 17 luck check to guess the creature's true name: A word in an ancient tongue meant to represent who a person is at the core of their soul. If successful, then it transforms into a hellion. If it fails, it is evaporated, leaving only a silhouette and any of its gear/clothing behind. Because this is such a slim chance of success, and creatures only get one shot, Brazzerian priests have done a great deal of research on how to improve the likelihood of a rituals success. Each of the below things can improve odds, adding additional bonuses to the luck check. * (+1) Double the mana cost. This can stack, but it must be doubled each time. * (+2) Convince the creature to be willing to transform, usually requiring appealing the the creatures ethos. * (Up to +3) Have detailed information on who the creature was in life. Major things, like events they regret, cherished family/friends, major accomplishments contribute more. * (Up to +3) Have items significant to what the creature was in life. Items like childhood treasures, wedding rings and signature weapons/armor contribute more. * (+2) Perform ritual in sanctified area. Such areas are rare instances where Brazzeria has visited the realm of mortals to perform miracles, and are closely guarded treasures. Other things can add to the bonus that aren't listed here as appropriate. Born Fiendish In very rare instances, creatures can be born fiends, such as when they are the child of a demon lord. Such fiends ignore most of the aforementioned rules: They can automatically succeed on the ritual if they are willing, and it always fails if they are not. Their changes tend to be less dramatic, allowing them to maintain most aspects of their fiendish form and powers, making them very rare catches for Brazzerians.",

Brazzeria is unique in that she and her followers can see the good in all but the most depraved of souls. More importantly, they also believe such creatures can be saved. They often form close intimate and personal relationships with people and creatures that many find unsavory. Combine that with their tendency towards acceptance of sexual deviancy and Brazzeria has a mixed reputation. Regardless of what mortals think, the immortal fiends of the world fear Brazzerian priests and priestesses more than anything. Brazzerian missionaries will travel to the fiendish infestations in the world to capture as many as possible for conversion, even traveling into the demon realm itself to keep a steady flow of purification rituals. Brazzeria is depicted as a light-skinned, small catgirl with feathered wings. Her skin typically covered in tattoos of gold and milky yellow. She wears minimal clothing, preferring to wear the coif portion of a nun's habit, and an ill fitting one that allows her golden hair to spill out of it. Outside of that she wears stockings and sleeve warmers, leaving censorship fairies to cover up the rest. Boons T1: Fiends are Friends (Su)\\ You get advantage on persuasion checks made against fiends. You can expend a use of prayer to get a general sense of distance and direction of the highest concentration of fiends within 100 miles. This prayer takes 1 minute. By succeeding on a planes check, or touching a fiend, you can tell if its soul/psyche is too shattered to be redeemed. This is most common in monstrous fiends, or amalgamations of souls. T2: Introductions (Su)\\ With physical contact, you can automatically tell what a creatures real name is, if it has one.&#x20; Intimate touch, such as kissing or...wrestling...gives you a nugget of info, as though you used the Psychic Reading spell.

This system is designed to provide active incentives for characters to enact the will of the deities in the world: the more that you please a god with your actions, follow their tenets and donate to their causes, the more favor they grant to you. The amount of favor that the gods provide to you is broken up into tiers. The first tier only grants minor boons. Trying to gain the favor of multiple gods only makes all of them hate you more: pick one and stick to it. In general, you cannot earn the favor of a god by accident.

This allows you see the rough percentage of hp they are missing. 17You awaken from the resurrection with a non magical silver ring clasped in your hands. It feels wrong to put it on anybody's hand who you don’t truly love. Once put on, DM decides if the love is true. If it isn't, the ring fades away. If it is, you gain a succ bond with them where both of you gain its benefits.18You can speak telepathically to creatures you are in direct contact with.19Whenever you bleed, you bleed water.

Over the course of a minute, bubble buddy will quickly inconvenience people to show what a bad possible outcome is for interacting with this specific person or type of person. Such as spilling a dwarf's drink, or poking someone very sensitive to touch. If you allow it, bubbly buddy will continue interacting with people all around a social setting, such as a party, a tavern etc and ruin the mood.

In either case, you must target a mirror. When you do so, the contents of the mirror are set in stone and cease to reflect reality, instead creating its own little world that resembles what it reflected. Hosteling You cast this version on a mirror in order to create an extradimensional space with some interesting quirks. The space itself is a copy of everything within a 30ft distance from the mirror. This means the mirror realm can capture entire rooms, including things that are hidden from line of sight (such as behind furniture) This allows your extradimensional space to contain furniture for instance. No effects can come in or out of the mirror realm, but both sides can see what is on the other side of the mirror, barring any kind of physical obstructions that would prevent sight (such as drapery). By tapping on the mirror from either side you can cause the noise to carry over. On casting the spell you can include a password that needs to be spoken in order to walk into the mirror (no action). This password can be changed with 1 minute of concentration from the caster. You can also update the mirror's appearance to keep it inconspicuous should the environment change drastically. The caster can go blind and deaf temporarily to project their senses into the mirror realm at will indefinitely. Objects cannot be brought out, nor can objects be brought in aside from what the average humanoid can reasonably carry on their person. Any such objects left behind are shunted out, along with any creatures, if the mirror is destroyed or the spell ends. Can be made permanent using 2,000g worth of powdered rare metals as an addition material component during casting Trapping When casting the trapping form, you must target a creature AND an appropriately sized mirror (both of which need to be in range of you, but not each other). If the creature fails its save, it is immediately sucked into the mirror (with a similar setting as the aforementioned hosteling effect). No other creature can enter the mirror realm without another casting of this spell. This does not prevent it from taking actions, but it can no longer interact with anything outside of the mirror realm, nor can any creature interact with the trapped individual. The target is stranded. They can see out of the mirror by standing next to it. The only way they can escape is by having an ally destroy the mirror, or by waiting for 1 minute. In either case, the creature appears in a random space within 15 feet of the mirror's line of sight.",

The size of what you create is limited to a 5x5x5 ft cube, but other than that, there are few limitations. You can create a fire, and it (seems to) gives off heat. You can create a dog and it bounces around in its space and barks. You can create a door that creaks as it swings on its broken hinges. When you initially cast the spell, you decide a type of behavior that your imaginary creation exhibits. Maybe you want your person that you made to dance, but then the party you're at the music stops. You can spend a standard action concentrating on the spell (as long as you have line of sight to your imagination) to have it change behaviors to instead bow before a king. You cannot change what you imagine, but you can change what your imagination does. Your imagination isn't limited to the laws of physics, so you can have it do incredibly unusual things, like having a person swim through air or a rock doing flips. However, when creatures see unusual stimuli like that, they get a save to disbelieve it. If someone points out it’s a fake, other creatures automatically see through it and it appears translucent to them. When used in combat, creatures may waste their time attacking the imaginary creature, but instead of rolling attacks or the imagination rolling saves, the attacking creature rolls a save. Failed saves indicate they miss or the creature resists the attack. Passed saves indicate they see through the ruse, and they can communicate this to their allies, making them automatically disbelieve it, causing the illusion appear translucent to all. The \"concentration\" part of the duration allows you to indefinitely maintain this imagination as long as you concentrate each turn as a standard action. You must have line of sight to the imagination to concentrate on it. If you do not concentrate on the spell for 1 minute, it disappears. Upcast - Each additional mana you spend increases the dimensions by 5 ft on all sides, to a max of 4 mana and 20x20x20 dimensions. By spending 5 mana, the duration also changes to permanent, no longer requiring concentration. Dispel magic automatically succeeds against permanent imaginations.&#x20;",

Spell Failure By default, spells have a 100% chance of being cast, but certain things can cause spell failure. When spell failure causes your spell to fail, the resource used to cast it is consumed. A spell failing is usually shortened to \"fizzles.\" Combining Magic Effects Many spells give you some kind of buff, or generate some kind of persistent effect. You can only have one type of each of the following effects active at once. \\[Concentration]\\ An effect with the concentration tag requires some degree of upkeep from the user and typically has a duration. Things like wall spells and summons have the concentration tag. \\[Buff]\\ An ability with the buff tag grants a boon to the creature it is applied to (and not necessarily the user). A creature can only have one effect with the buff tag active at once. Buffs can only be cast on willing creatures. Weather Certain high level spells manipulate the weather in drastic ways. If multiple casters attempt to cast different spells that affect the weather, the creature with the higher CL always wins.

      "content": "Technique Rules Progression in this game is broken up into 3 main distinct categories: Class features, feats and techniques. This section is dedicated to techniques. Techniques use a point system to represent how invested you are in a specific technique, from 1 to 6. Techniques are often things that you use in combat, such as special attacks and spells. Memory When you have technique points invested in a specific style, you can prepare any of the techniques of the tier you have unlocked. Memory determines how many techniques you can have prepared or \"memorized\" at any given time and thus what you can use on a dime. All techniques are assumed to take 1 memory unless stated otherwise. Special attacks from items/class/etc and cantrips to not require memory. Using Multiple Techniques a Turn Techniques can be any kind of action, leading them to be able to be used twice, maybe even more times a turn. Techniques are not balanced in such a way to be allowed to freely use some of your most powerful abilities multiple times a turn. Therefore there is an inherent limit tied to techniques. You can only use up to 2 levels of techniques at level 1, 3 at level 3, 4 at level 5 etc, increasing by 1 every 2 levels and capping at 7 by level 11. This essentially limits you to using level 1 techniques in tandem with your most powerful available techniques.&#x20; This limit even applies to innate techniques, however there is a small exception. Sometimes you may receive some incredible boon, or a monster might have a technique a bit higher than their level might suggest. In such cases, no additional techniques can be used in the same turn as this high level technique. Innate Casting/Techniques Some techniques can be granted outside of the standard progression, such as things gained from race, class, magic item, specialized training, or some kind of boon granted by another creature. Usually quite limited in scope and much more common on monsters. Innate techniques do not take up memory slots and are always memorized. Innate techniques grant creatures the ability to use a specific set of techniques. Spells do not require the staff/seal component that other casting typically requires. If a spell has a material or focus component, that is also ignored with innate casting. By default, creatures with innate techniques can use their techniques an unlimited number of times. Number values are included next to techniques that have limited uses per day. Mana burn still applies to innately casted spells. But otherwise they cost no mana. If a spell is constant, the spell is persistently active on the creature and takes up its buff slot. A new buff can be cast on it, rendering the constant spell inactive. If its constant spell is deactivated, it can reactivate it as a swift action. Technique Progression In general, classes get access to a few technique trees. Techniques are separated into six levels, requiring 6 points of investment in order to reach the highest tier. At every even level, you get a technique point you can invest in any form of technique. For every point you invest, you get access to a new level of technique. * There are some limitations. You cannot invest all of your technique points into the techniques your class specializes in to get access to high level abilities extremely early. Technique levels have a hard character level requirement, as shown below… * | Technique Level (and points required) | Character Level | | ------------------------------------- | --------------- | | 1 | 1 | | 2 | 3 | | 3 | 5 | | 4 | 7 | | 5 | 9 | | 6 | 11 | Techniques are also separated into two different general categories: martial and magic. Each class typically has a specialization in either one of these categories. Martial/Magical Specialization With martial specialization, you automatically gain points in warfare equal to the highest level of investment you have in martial techniques (ex. Have barbarism 3? You also have warfare 3). Magical specialization as a baseline gives you access to cantrips. You know 6 cantrips. You do not need to spend memory in order to prepare cantrips.\\ You automatically gain points in wild card equal to the highest level of investment you have in magical techniques (ex. Have pyromancy 3? You also have wild card 3). Upcast My spending additional mana, you can increase the effectiveness of the technique. Some techniques scale per additional mana spent and others require thresholds to get completely new effects.\\ You can only ever spend 6 mana on a technique.",
