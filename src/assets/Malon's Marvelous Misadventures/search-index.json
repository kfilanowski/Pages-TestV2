Undead created by outside forces are constantly suffering a cruel fate, forced to live in broken bodies and without a will of their own. Casters that engage in this magic must be wary, as every day that passes runs the risk of letting the latent memories in these spirits manifest into wills of their own with their only desire being to destroy the caster that enslaved them. In the same vein, a caster that respects the wishes of a created undead can use their unfinished desires to their advantage, using alliances over enslavement to form lasting bonds until they are put to rest.",

They promote treating creatures with mercy whenever possible, and in the most extreme examples, can make death impossible. Their aura is powerful enough that existing near them makes you safer. 1 - Aura of Mercy Supernatural Creatures in your Protective Aura cannot die. This aura has a distinct, personalized visual component that interferes with stealth. 1 - Lucky Break Immediate Action, At-Will. Add LUK to a Roll in your Protective Aura. You cannot add LUK twice to a given Roll. 1 - Compassion Mind-Affecting When you use Channel Energy, enemies in range that were aggressors/not acting in self-defense are Pacified for 5 rounds (Will negates). They get a new save at the end of their turns if you or your allies take aggressive actions versus their allies, and it ends immediately if you or your allies take aggressive actions towards them. If there are no enemies left, initiative ends, and this ability can be extended for up to 10 minutes as long as you try resolving the conflict peacefully. 2 - Cure Supernatural Healing When you use Healing Touch, creatures get a new save against any lingering effects that would normally give additional saves (such as Poisoned and some Mind-Affecting effects). Does not apply to permanent status like Cursed or Drained. 2 - Endure Elements Creatures that touch your Aura of Mercy receive a blessing for 1 hour. This blessing allows them to exist inside of otherwise hazardous environments without harm. Blessed creatures ignore environmental effects like toxic volcanic gas, thin air at extreme heights, extremes in temperature, the vacuum of space or the pressure/lack of air in underwater environments.

This effect does not require line of sight. 4 - Focus Dispel Supernatural Standard Action, Recharge. Touch a creature. On an ally, one harmful Spell or Supernatural effect immediately ends, unless it is permanent. On an enemy, this functions as Dispel.

Some situations can naturally be neutralized by dropping a cage in the right place, but such conveniences are rare. More often than not, restraining your foe is going to involves rope and cuffs. #Cuffs Grabbing and already-grabbed creature allows you to put cuffs on them. One grab is needed per appendage cuffed. You cannot cuff a creature on your own unless you can grab multiple times per turn, in which case you need another free hand. This provokes AoO. This completely prevents the use of their arms outside of simple item interactions. Cuffs can also be placed on the legs to reduce a creatures speed to 15. Combat maneuvers made against a cuffed creature gain a +10 bonus. Cuffs are difficult to escape, and even harder to break. They typically require outside assistance in order to be removed. Because cuffs are typically made from iron and steel, they can take a significant beating. DC to break (Athletics) or lockpick (Hands) is dependent on the type of material and the lock. A typical forged cuff is DC 40 to break, or 20 to pick. Creatures that are bound can try to free themselves, but take a -5 penalty. #Rope Grabbing and already-grabbed creature allows you to tie them with rope. One grab is needed per appendage tied. You cannot tie up a creature on your own unless you can grab multiple times per turn, in which case you need another free hand. This provokes AoO. Rope is easier to destroy than cuffs, but it is also easier to make the restraint more intense. By grabbing one more time, you can prevent the creature from acting completely. Rope tends to be a good way to bind singular creatures, since anybody with a sharp implement can handily free a bound creature. Rope can be destroyed with an attack from any slashing weapon. Using Athletics or Acrobatics, you can pull the ropes apart, but the DC is determined by the athletics bonus of the creature who bound you (30+their athletics bonus). Creatures that are bound can try to free themselves, but take a -5 penalty. This penalty can be ignored with a natural attack suitable for freeing yourself, or a slashing concealed weapon. #Container Grabbing and already-grabbed creature allows you to forcefully shove them into an object within reach such as a bag, barrel, or box, so long as they can handily fit in the object. Whether or not they can escape generally depends on the object and the tools the captured creature has on hand. Wooden crates don’t do to well when trying to hold barbarians or crafty characters with crowbars. DC to break (Athletics) is dependent on the type of material. Some objects can be handily dealt with, not requiring a skill check. A knife makes quick work of a bag, and given enough space, hammers break boxes. Creatures that are bound can try to free themselves, but take a -5 penalty.",

Content is currently being made with a roll equivalent to counting successes on a d15 die, exploding on any number above 1, success being any roll (including the first). This can be written into rolling simulator websites such as Roll20 to speed things up. The benefit of this method is that anyone can roll any number, unlike other systems where a large enough target number will make the roll impossible. The Short Version: Every point added for or against these rolls is about a 7% difference in power. This means Attack Rolls, Skill checks, Saving Throws, DCs, Avoid, all of it. A 6 point difference is roughly a 50% boost in odds. A 10 point difference is about double. As an example, if you gain 10 Accuracy or 10 Stealth, your odds of success are about twice as high.

      "content": "Crafting is the use of specific Profession skills to create items. In terms of gameplay, Crafting rewards players that use Resources gained in their adventures with a more efficient use of those resources. As an example, a flaming dragon hide that is normally worth 10000g might normally only sell for 5000g (as items only sell for half of their value by default), but is worth its full 10000g when used to Craft an appropriate item with it. It is also useful for acquiring items when there is no civilization from which to purchase them. Most crafting is done with 3 components: Resources, Mana Crystal, and Labor. When deciding to Craft an item, first determine how much of the item's value will be provided in Resources, how much will be Mana, and how much will be Labor. We will be using the Cleaving Axe as an example. Typically, half of an item's value is Resources, such as metals or special Loot. Non-magical items can have up to 75% of their value in Resources, while magic items can have as little as 25%. Unless specified on the item, players are free to choose how much value they want to assign to Resources within these bounds. A Cleaving Axe is worth 2000g, so let's assume in this case we want to minimize the time to craft, and assign 75% of its value in Resources. A Cleaving Axe only requires metal to be crafted. That means we need to have or buy 1500g of metal, and reduces the remaining value to 500g. A Cleaving Axe requires 1 Mana to craft. Any player can easily afford to sacrifice 1 Mana at some point during the crafting process to satisfy this requirement. This reduces the remaining value to 495g. The player then needs to provide labor to complete the process. The Labor provided must be done using a Profession skill that is related to the item being crafted, such as Cooking for Food, or Weaponsmith for a Weapon. Let's assume the player has a +10 bonus in their Profession: Weaponsmith skill. By Economics rules, they can complete 140g of value per day. This means it would take them 495/140 = 3.5 days of work to craft this item. If they had a friend with a related profession, they could assist too, and speed up the Labor process.",

Most Mundane items have almost no Mana requirements, but Magic Items tend to have substantial amounts, and powerful Magic Items and Rituals tend to require exorbitant amounts of Mana. The purpose of Mana Crystal requirements is to give innate value to populations and followership. Churches and kingdoms will establish donation sites to accumulate the power of their people, and will be unwilling to share those resources with just anyone. Those that have access to Mana have access to power in the world. Nobody can easily create powerful artifacts alone. See Mana Donation.

      "content": "By going to specialized facilities, or by going to churches with gilded altars, an untrained creature can donate Mana via Mana Burn. A creature can safely donate up to one less than their maximum. There are usually safeguards against donating your max mana, but less savory individuals don't mind. Spending your max mana gives you the Tier 3 Affliction Mana Starvation. This means that most common people are only able to donate 1 Mana each day. Children typically do not possess enough Mana to safely donate. Specialized facilities and gilded altars are incredibly expensive, typically costing hundreds of thousands of gold to craft. This makes it so facilities for mana donation tend to be rather sparse, only located in sizable settlements with magical and religious influence. When mana is extracted, it is turned into a Mana Crystal. Mana Crystals are versatile and can change between states of matter, becoming either liquid or solid for ease of storage. Each point of mana can earn 5g in a mana extraction facility. In a church, it earns food and lodging for the day. Accumulation of Mana Most religious services happen in the evening after work, so that way people may spend their mana as they wish during the day, and donate it at night if they wish. With large generous populations this can mean that you can amass large quantities of mana rather quickly. Because most people can only donate 1 mana, you can almost 1:1 translate a population of donors to daily mana generation. Not everybody who donates has commoner tier mana, but at the same time, not everybody can always donate! So the 1:1 ratio is generally the go-to method of determining mana generation over time. Again, not all places have the correct facilities, so this is often available in villages.",

      "content": "Estimating the true value of a single unit of currency is difficult to do when considering the possibilities of every setting. However, in order to establish some reference for pricing adventuring gear and items, we have to settle on one - so, for the purposes of the default pricing and earnings, we're going forward with the assumption that the differences between the peasants, tradesmen, and aristocrats is large, but not in such a way that compromises the ability of the peasantry to afford basic items. As a fantasy setting with swords and monsters, there are comparisons to be made to the value of labor in the medieval era. However, in order to avoid mixing the complexities of medieval economics with magic and superheroes to an audience that may not have studied such, the gap between the peasants and aristocrats is reduced, and social mobility is substantially increased. If a more extreme economy is desired, adjust the earnings from Economics and The Cost of Living. Average laborers like farmers can be expected to make ~10-20k gold every year, with the amount increasing with more sophisticated trades such as smiths or merchants. Gold pieces are small coins and are virtually weightless due to the minting process performed by the financial wizards. Another benefit of this minting is that it causes gold pieces to naturally stack into specific values (5, 10, 20, 100, 1000). Someone can easily hold 100g in their pockets, or 1000g in a dedicated pouch. Anything more and they are bursting at the seams and would be better off with a bank, or to switch to alternative methods of payment. Carrying around a bag of 100,000g would be like the real-world equivalent of carrying around a several briefcases full of paper currency. While this may happen for large transactions or when hauling away a dragon's horde, it's usually difficult to avoid drawing attention if you were to do it on the regular. When imagining gold costs, use the following: | Item Rarity | Cost Range | Description | | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Cheap | 1-100g | Items used for regular, day-to-day activities fall in this category. Food, clothing, a stay at an inn, or common alchemy or building materials fall in this range. The lower end is comprised of items like bread, candy, and clothing, while the high end may be specialized items like light weaponry, trade tools, and padlocks. | | Common | 101-1k | Common items are generally purchased less often than cheap ones by most. On the low end you get something like a furnace installation for a house, a med kit, minor potions, or a fancy outfit, and on the high end you get heavy armors, wagons, and masterwork weaponry. | | Expensive | 1k-25k | Expensive items must be saved up for by most common folk. These include long-distance travel vehicles, the average magic item and goods made with rare metals. On the low end you get good deals on failed magic items, high quality potions, and upgrade scrolls. On the high end you get something like a cannon, a sailing ship, or a meager home. | | Rare | 25k-250k | Rare items are usually reserved for the rich, or require loans, savings, or groups to pool funds to purchase. This includes houses, battleships, and masterfully crafted items that have been upgraded substantially. | | Unique | 250k+ | Large construction projects, ancient tomes of secrets, coveted legendary equipment, and expenses that are usually only sustainable by an entire town's contributions lie here. |",

It is the slower, more efficient alternative to Potions, which may grant their benefits briefly or in smaller amounts at a moment's notice. It is assumed all food items are portioned properly as a meal, and cooked to preserve. They never spoil as long as they are handled properly and are not damaged directly, such as by fire. Perishable Ingredients will spoil unless cooked. Food is consumed during a Short Rest over 15 minutes, unless otherwise stated. Food primarily restores HP, but may grant bonus effects until you eat again or Long Rest. The value of a particular food increases with how much it heals, what it grants, and how little it weighs. Because of how varied food can be, its value will often lead to haggling - however, at the very least, any such item will be worth more than its components.

      "content": "Weapons are the most basic method of increasing one's offensive power. Just having a weapon and attacking an enemy is often enough to make you a substantial threat, regardless of your expertise or abilities. Weapons fall into Weapon Groups for the purpose of identifying what Special Attacks, Abilities, and Techniques they're compatible with. The categories describe how they are used to attack, rather than how they look. If a weapon has more than one main category, then that means its category changes based on the way it is used, such as throwing a dagger instead of swinging it. There are ten main categories: | Type | Description | | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Axe | Can be 1-handed or 2-handed. Weapons made to cut or pierce using chopping motions. | | Blade | Can be 1-handed or 2-handed. Blades meant for slicing and stabbing, relying on the blade to do the cutting with a mere touch rather than chopping or committed thrusts. | | Bludgeon | Can be 1-handed or 2-handed. Bludgeons to beat the snot out of enemies in the most primitive way possible. | | Bow | Always 2-handed. Curved weapons held at the ends by taut or resistant elastic strings used for firing ammunition with a drawing motion. | | Close | Always \"1-handed.\" Punches, kicks, claws, and headbutts that can be used in the closest of combat, even when pinned. These attacks can be with one's own natural weapons, or with weapons augmenting limbs. | | Dagger | Always 1-handed. Short, sharp weapons for getting close to enemies and striking weak spots or overwhelming them with angles of attack. | | Polearm | Always 2-handed. Long skirmish weapons for battlefield versatility. They combine the spacing of spears with the swings of axes. Often used to hook enemies in addition to being general weapons. | | Thrown/Caster | Almost always 1-handed. Weapons designed to be thrown using a swing from the hand or sling. Casters are armored gauntlets with thrown ammunition stored inside, used to draw and throw faster and harder. | | Thrust | Can be 1-handed or 2-handed. Blades and spears meant for dedicated thrusts to put enormous pressure at a single point. Often used to outrange and lunge at opponents. | | Trigger | Can be 1-handed or 2-handed. Weapons with handles that are loaded beforehand and then fire their ammunition with a trigger. Trigger weapons require an Action-Attack to reload. Trigger weapons do not add STR to damage. | And 4 subtypes: | Type | Description | | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Ammunition | Arrows, bolts, rocks, bullets, darts, or any other weapon that is either part of another weapon's use, or that is meant to be launched by itself in quick succession. This can also be a main group.Ammunition can be drawn as an Instant Action. Ammunition and its price and weight represent an unlimited source. You cannot easily \"share\" or otherwise split Ammunition between allies. You either have the ammunition or you don't - Exceptions can be made in the heat of combat, such as firing back an arrow that just hit a tree next to you. | | Natural Weapon | Weapons that are part of a creature's being. Examples include claws, fists, tails, horns, stingers, and tentacles. Most natural weapons are not universal, meaning they are different for each creature that has them and will be noted as such in their stat block. However, they do follow common trends. | | Shield | These weapons are also shields. | | Staff | These weapons qualify for completing the Staff component of spells, and may have additional statistics as a result. | Exotic Weapons do not neatly fit into these categories, and will list how they differ. Weapons come with damage values, attack speed values, and damage types as their core stats, in addition to the categories listed above. All standard weapons deal a physical Damage type. If a weapon has more than one damage type, you can decide which to use before you make a given attack with it. Damage values and Attack Speed correlate such that the damage tends to be very similar without any additional abilities or STR. The typical offense-oriented damage values and AS are as follows: | Speed | Damage | Use | | ----- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | 5 | d4 | Best used with higher stats, On-Hit Effects, or in conjunction with other actions. | | 4 | d6 | Most versatile. | | 3 | d10 | Middle-ground option for one-handed uses and Dual Wielding. | | 2 | 2d8 | Best value with bonus attacks and Techniques. | Weapons with ranged capabilities (thrown or otherwise) will also have a listed range. Ranges come in an X/Y format, with the X range being the accurate range, and the Y taking a -4 penalty, referred to as the Range. | Range Category | Value | | -------------- | ------ | | Thrown | 20/40 | | Short | 40/60 | | Long | 60/120 | Some weapons come with Techniques and Special Attacks. These temporarily grant you a technique as long as you wield them. As per the Mana rules, you cannot sacrifice your own Mana to get another use of a Limited Technique unless otherwise stated. Special Attacks specifically are also tied to the weapon - If you use the Special Attack, you cannot pass the weapon off to another creature to use it again, and the weapon has its own Recharge timer. Many weapons come with Weapon Qualities. These describe what a weapon does beyond its classification, Damage, and AS. Unless otherwise stated, Weapons weights default to the following: | Group | Weight | | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | | Close, Dagger, 1h Blade, Sword-Like 1h Thrust weapons | 2 | | 1h Axe/Crush/Thrust, Bow | 5 | | 2h Axe/Blade/Crush/Thrust, Ammunition, Caster, Polearm, Trigger | 10 |",

      "content": "The Equivocation of Optional Mechanics as Difficulty Management in Video Games Preamble In the ongoing conversation about difficulty in games, it is crucial to recognize the different ways designers shape challenge—whether through numeric adjustments, increased enemy complexity, or opt-in mechanics like summoning or assistive features. Unfortunately, many argue that all optional mechanics are neutral tools for difficulty management that do not impact the core gameplay experience. As players and developers, we should focus on creating environments that allow individuals to experience the game in the way they prefer—including doing so without imposing significant changes that undermine the integrity of the core challenge. The goal should be to empower players while respecting both the game’s design and their personal approach to difficulty. How We Make Things Accessible In the gaming landscape, the design of difficulty and balance is a necessary part of accessibility for users with handicaps - especially in harder titles. Players that are too old or too new, that have responsibilities that pull them from the game, limited time, or that simply lack the necessary abilities to enjoy a game should have the necessary means to level the playing field. The design of difficulty in games can be broadly categorized into three distinct approaches: numeric, complexity-based, and opt-in mechanics. - Numeric difficulty involves straightforward adjustments such as increasing enemy health, damage output, or resource scarcity, making encounters more difficult through quantifiable means. This is the most simple approach, and is used as part of the other approaches - but alone is often only appropriate for games with minimalist mechanics and low skill expression. - Complexity-based difficulty, on the other hand, will change enemies to act with more intelligence, have more varied abilities and attack patterns, and require players to master the mechanics already present in the game to keep up. This is often the preferred method for any game with strategy or skill expression, but is the most taxing to implement. - Finally, opt-in mechanics—such as summoning allies, flying, or activating other assistive features—allow players to choose whether to bypass or mitigate certain challenges altogether. While these mechanics are often presented as optional tools for difficulty management, their adoption and integration can fundamentally alter the player’s experience. There's a clear outlier here. There are no limits to what developers can put into their games as \"optional\" mechanics. The flexibility is a double-edged sword, as the implementation can just as easily ruin the experience if there is not an appropriate alternative or less invasive means. For the purposes of this discussion, I will mainly refer to Skyrim, Mario, and Elden Ring. Attention to Detail All three methods of designing difficulty can easily interrupt the core gameplay experience when implemented thoughtlessly. In Skyrim, there is very little strategy and skill expression. At best, the player can move out of the range of some enemy attacks and strike back between them, or properly aim an arrow. Beyond that, the game is no different to MMOs such as RuneScape, where the player either engages in a slap fight whose winner is determined entirely by opposing statistics and how much healing is in their inventories, or the player stands out of reach of a melee opponent and attacks them with ranged weapons until they die helplessly. Skyrim uses numeric difficulty. Despite being the easiest approach, there are major oversights in its implementation that force players to use specific playstyles or exploits to keep up. For example, a player that wants to use primarily destruction magic will be greatly disappointed on higher difficulties as their entire Magicka bar is depleted defeating a single lesser bandit, and the abysmal regeneration rate and lack of potions will force them to resort to sword fighting or the use of AI exploits and loading zones. As the game progresses, the only way to have enough Magicka to defeat enemies without hours of grinding is through Alchemy-Enchanting exploits that bring the cost of spells to 0, or their damage to arbitrarily high numbers—the latter of which completely defeats the purpose of the numeric difficulty increase. Complexity-based difficulty is the hardest to implement. With the exception of complexity through AI improvements, it requires making more content on top of what should already be an adequate amount of content for lower difficulties. The more mechanics an enemy has, the higher the odds that they will invalidate a certain method of playing the game and require players to do something they are not interested in. For example, if the difficulty is in higher enemy aggression, then any playstyle that relies on large openings is going to suffer disproportionately. If the difficulty is in close-range incapacitation, then melee players will suffer more than ranged ones. Sacrificing some part of the original experience is often inevitable. There are exceptions where the numeric and complexity approaches meet. The speed of a game and the precision of its timings are a good example—Most of the game remains untouched, and a small adjustment in the reaction time necessary to beat the game can be the difficulty a player wants. At the crux of the issue lies difficulty through optional mechanics. These are the most likely to change the experience of a player. In Elden Ring, the variety of abilities in the game ranges from completely impractical to game-trivializing superpowers. Some are very similar to each other, such as two weapons of the same class with similar movesets that have wildly different performance. Most are not at all similar, making the experience when switching from one to the next completely different. Despite this, one could make an argument that the difficulty in the game rises from which strategies the player chooses. The most polarizing optional mechanic is Summoning. This changes the game from single player to Co-Op vs AI, or Co-Op and AI vs AI. Using this, a player can use NPC assistants to make enemies ignore the player, or simply ask a friend to beat the game for them while they watch. The extreme nature of this mechanic has caused heated debate in online communities as to what extent an optional mechanic can be used to manage difficulty before it simply becomes thinly veiled cheating. What is Cheating? Cheating in most games is simply breaking the rules to your benefit. In the context of early video games, cheating was specifically programmed into games using \"cheat codes\" that would allow players to break the rules. Later, specialized pieces of hardware such as Action Replay were introduced that are akin to modern hex editors, allowing players to cheat by changing any variable they could find, far beyond what developers willingly included in their games. All of these were widely agreed to be forms of cheating. And yet, the definition of cheating became more flexible as time passed, even though little changed in what players were capable of. In Super Mario games, there exist powerups that grant the player complete invincibility combined with another powerup that only appear when a player has died in a level multiple times. These are essentially easily accessible god modes that can be used to skip content that is too difficult or boring to play normally, or for any other reason the players see fit. There is no code that needs to be input. There is no need to go out of one's way to obtain these powerups. They aren't even labeled as cheats. They are even included with explicit intent to be used by a portion of the player base—while many cheats in the past were added just for the sake of having cheats (such as with Big Head Mode) or as rewards for completing the game. And yet, despite the lack of labeling, there is a subtle acknowledgement that using these is different than beating the game \"normally.\" Achievements and collectibles will look different, scores may be altered, and the game otherwise records your use of these items to give your completion of the game an asterisk. The difference between invincibility powerups and other cheats is that invincibility powerups are deliberate additions intended to help players of lower skill or patience complete the game. They are easy, low-effort inclusions that sacrifice a portion of the gameplay for an easier experience, which would sour the experience for players that do not need them. They are still, however, cheats. They break the rules to your benefit. In Skyrim (PC), the player can, at any time, open the console to manipulate the game via console commands. This is more akin to classic cheat codes, where no player would be able to guess what they need to type into the console to cause a specific effect without looking up the codes, but is closer to the power of hex editors in terms of possibilities. Skyrim's console blurs the concept of cheating far more than a handicap feature would. Unlike other cheat codes, the use of the console is far more common even among players that do not like cheats for one reason: Skyrim does not function as a game. Did the player get stuck in random map geometry? The console allows them to teleport out. Did a quest break? The console can skip to the next step. Did the game crash? The console can be used to restore progress without needing to replay content. By definition, these are all instances of cheating, yet many would decline to call it such. Cheating has a harsh connotation that someone is cheapening an experience by breaking the rules, and yet this time the cheats are used specifically to improve the experience of a broken game—and arguably play closer to the rules as intended. Developer Intentions How do you know what a developer's intentions are? Intuition is a helpful tool, but it is also often wrong. Unless someone spoke their intentions, there cannot be certainty... But we can still make reasonably educated guesses. In Elden Ring, a common argument in favor of using anything the game offers is that, if it's in the game, it's intended to be used. The developers wouldn't have added it if they didn't intend for players to use it. This is obviously a baseless assertion, and there are plenty of examples where this intuitive reasoning falls short. Soon after the game's release, there were debates as to whether or not weapons such as Rivers of Blood and summons such as Mimic Tear were so powerful as to be unintended, or even be considered cheating. Players that defended these inclusions used the above argument, only to later find that both of these (and some underlying systems that improved them) were patched to reduce their effectiveness. Which one was truly the intended way of playing the game? Was it before or after the developers changed it? What else will the developers change? Can developers change their intentions? Some players that use this argument will make exceptions. For example, some enemies can be coerced into falling off of the map to their deaths, or get stuck such that they are easy targets. These will be exception cases, because their intuition tells them that the developers did not intend for enemies to simply fall off of the map and die on their own. And yet, despite the developers being able to modify the game however they wish, patches keep going by where these supposedly unintended inclusions remain untouched. When observing the design of the game, it is reasonable to try and guess developer intentions based on conflicting design principles and a charitable interpretation of the intelligence of whoever made it, even without the say of the developers. If in the vast majority of cases a condition is true, except for one specific case where there does not seem to be any reason for the deviation, an argument can be made that the aberration is not intended. For example, in Elden Ring, there are almost always methods to avoid an instance of damage as a player of reasonable reaction time and positioning. Enemy attack patterns will place the attacks in such a way that that is always the case for their target. However, if there are multiple enemies, an attack may be placed in such a way that it is avoidable for the primary target, but not for any others nearby. This can be considered an unintentional side effect of the optional mechanic of multiplayer. In Minecraft (Java Edition), players frequently modify the game using third party programs to drastically alter the gaming experience in ways far outside of the scope of the original game. It would be reasonable to assume that the intentions of the developer do not take into account anything a player may find in the landscape of unofficial changes to the game. Some of these modifications may be considered cheating, while most are considered changing the game entirely such that it is no longer \"truly\" Minecraft. However, there are modifications to the game whose only purpose is to improve the performance of the game, allowing more players the ability to play the game at all. Some modifications fix behaviors and perceived oversights to make the game more consistent. Are these third party changes bringing the experience closer to what was intended? The Minecraft speed-running community certainly thinks that some do. Performance-boosting modifications that do not change the basic rules of the game are allowed and encouraged. It's intuitive that the game running better rather than worse is the intention of the developers. Being able to reset the game more quickly or load faster are generally accepted to not be considered in the realm of cheating due to not affecting the integrity of the performance of the player during their speed-run. There it is—Integrity. Integrity There is a sort of principled superiority that cheating is playing the game \"wrong,\" and that accomplishments that were only acquired via cheating are illegitimate. This intuitive understanding is highly attractive, as speaking with someone who claims the same accomplishments as yourself while having a different experience reaching that goal will inevitably cause a disconnect. It can invoke feelings of mockery, as if your efforts are being undermined and cheapened by someone with a GameShark. Cheaters that are perceived to lack integrity are seen as dishonest and insincere. It is no surprise that people will be on the lookout for any examples of something that can be seen as cheating. Whenever there are perceived rules and the perceived breaking of said rules, there will be conflict among players. Developers should keep this aspect of human nature in mind when designing their game, especially if they do not put any effort into explaining their intentions to the players. Players are less inclined to fuss about cheating and accomplishments when difficulty and handicaps are properly communicated to them. When numeric and complexity difficulties are clearly labeled \"Easy,\" \"Medium,\" and \"Hard\" with descriptions of their effects, and opt-in mechanics are properly balanced or labeled as handicaps, players are more likely to be able to have civil discussions about the game's design. At the end of the day, the purpose of games is to have fun. Players will act in accordance with what they find most enjoyable (and accessible), and they will associate with other players that have similar values to their own. Players are also not expected to have the emotional intelligence or logic capacity to put together well-reasoned and compassionate arguments to connect with others that do not think like them. They are expected to complain, pick sides, and attack anyone with opposing views, needlessly causing divides that the developers could have easily avoided. Analyzing Examples of Poor Difficulty Implementation and Arguments Elden Ring is a gold mine of thoughtless arguments and assumptions from players due to the vague and often half-baked implementation of its core difficulty management mechanics. For this, we will be focusing on the debate around the users of summons against solo/difficulty purists, as both sides suffer from astounding levels of shortsightedness on the subject. Let's start with solo purists that claim that anyone that used summons did not truly \"beat the game\" and that they \"played the game wrong.\" There are legitimate arguments to be made about the poor implementation and incredible variance in effectiveness from the use of summons. Truly, they can be akin to using a Super Leaf in Mario games to skip entire areas and bosses from the sheer power that having another player or ally in a fight can bring. The way enemies do not take into account the presence of additional enemies for their choice of actions reveals a lack of polish or worse. In some cases, enemy AI will simply cease to function when a creature is defeated, or their movements and bodies will become unnatural as they change targets mid-attack, resulting in deceptive and jarring visuals that do not appear as intended behavior. However, there is no reason to attack others for choices made for the purposes of entertainment in what may as well be a single-player game. Without the developers defining what it means to beat the game, like in Mario, the player's assertions are baseless. As the player progresses further into the game, many of the enemies have identical gameplay with only minor cosmetic differences—and enormously increased statistics. It is not uncommon for a player to fight a generic soldier with a sword and trade hits to defeat them in one blow, only to find the exact same enemy wearing a different color shirt that can kill the player in a single blow. It is entirely possible for a player to simply not have enough ammunition to defeat even a single enemy from differences in numeric difficulty, resulting in certain playstyles being invalidated via arithmetic impossibility. What would normally be a method of difficulty control instead becomes a burden for the player to level up their character to unreasonable strength, skewing the experience unnecessarily because of arbitrary restrictions from the developers. Furthermore, the action of increasing one's level has no relation to the core gameplay experience or player skill. If a player wishes to improve their numerical abilities until winning is possible, they will most likely resort to repeatedly resting at a save point and attacking defenseless enemies for an arbitrary amount of time until they have enough points to do so. There is no option to use skill to increase one's ability to deal damage when the resources used to do so are limited - if you have ten shots, and the enemy can survive eleven, no amount of skill will help you win. The increase in \"difficulty\" using numbers serves no purpose except to waste hours of a player's time when players opt for weaker strategies. Strategies and weapons that are stronger or weaker are often touted as the game's main way of adjusting difficulty. In many cases, these are legitimate, non-invasive methods that do not significantly alter the core gameplay experience. If a player likes a specific kind of weapon or spell, chances are there are alternatives that function similarly enough while being substantially more or less effective. It's always easier to reduce effectiveness, as a player can choose not to upgrade a weapon, but it is not always possible to increase the strength of a playstyle past a certain point. That is the point at which this method of difficulty implementation fails. It is a common argument among users of summons that anyone that complains about numeric difficulty while refusing to use opt-in playstyles is trapped in a cage of their own making. This view isn't just false, it's patronizing and misses the valid portion of the purist argument. Summoning, for example, changes the core experience of the game to such a degree that it can and will lead to questions of integrity and legitimacy in a run. Even inexperienced players identify that someone or something else defeating enemies for them \"feels\" like it made their own contributions irrelevant (because it did). That all tools the game offers are equally valid means of managing difficulty is an equivocation. To insist others use them in the same way they would an \"enemy health and damage multiplier\" lacks nuance and borders on dishonesty. To the purists, telling them to \"just summon\" is no different than telling them to \"just play Tetris instead,\" \"just use the Super Leaf,\" or \"have you considered handing the controller to your big brother?\" since, to them, it is either an alternative game experience that doesn't interest them, or actively cheapens the experience of the game akin to cheating, even if the developers did not say such. To them, the game simply lacks the means to make their chosen way of playing the right difficulty, and their way of playing the game for entertainment is just as valid as the summoners. This problem also exists in reverse. For example, what if someone wants to play with their friends, but does not want to make the game too easy? There are numeric ways to make yourself weaker, but the core experience is warped. No amount of self-restriction will make up for the fact that enemies in the game are not designed to act differently in the presence of multiple opponents. There is one last drawback of opt-in mechanics as difficulty, especially in Elden Ring: Not all mechanics are even available from the start. If you want to play the game from start to finish with Godfrey's Axe, you are required to either arrange for another player to drop the item for you, or you need to cheat. That's right: there are playstyles that are not even accessible. The game does not have a reasonable method to enjoy items granted only after beating the game. This is not even for balance reasons either, as items like Fire Giant's braid and Godfrey's Axe are incredibly weak weapons compared to similar ones obtainable earlier in the game. Limited items exist that never respawn or force players to waste time collecting rare resources, which needlessly punishes inexperienced or challenge run players that are more likely to fail when using them. Given everything discussed, using cheats for the purposes of enabling the game to be played in a specific way that does not affect the integrity of the core gameplay is something that should be reasonable to most. The issue is not cheating, it's integrity. There should always be methods of controlling difficulty within a given set of rules while respecting those rules, self-imposed or otherwise. If the developers fail to do so, it is perfectly within reason for players to point it out.",

      "content": "The Neglect of Mathematics and Game Balance in Tabletop Roleplaying Games Preamble In all forms of interactive storytelling where numbers are involved, the narratives and imaginations of those involved are grounded in and informed by the underlying mathematics and mechanics. Just like in the real world, math is the basis on which everything exists - change one variable, and the world and the cultures within will look much different. Despite this foundational importance, the math in TTRPGs is often neglected or not taken into consideration during its creation, causing the stories built on it to lack plausibility or the players to engage in degenerate gameplay loops that are better incentivized by the math. We must elevate the standards of game balance and mathematical principles within to ensure a stable play environment with maximal freedom of storytelling. For the purpose of this discussion, I'll mostly be referring to the design of Dungeons and Dragons, but these principles extend to all games, TTRPG or otherwise. The Value of Balance and Mathematics 1. The Foundation of the Universe Here in the real world, our actions are most often decided by their expected outcomes. People grow the food that produces the most in the local terrain, they wear protection to avoid death, they take the path of least resistance, they outlaw actions that harm others. If the outcomes or goals were different, the actions taken would be different - if stabbing someone was a pleasant experience that extended their lifespan, then the laws around stabbing people would be very different. If we only ate for pleasure, we would grow what tasted the best regardless of climate. This is true down to the very foundations of the universe, where the actions that the atoms and forces of the universe take are decided by simple rules. Light takes the path of least time, mass and energy act towards increased entropy, and other such rules determine how everything else acts. Just like in real life, expected outcomes are what guide us in TTRPGs. If the goal of the player is to live the longest and kill the most things, then the actions they take will be guided by what best gets them to that goal. Because this is based on probability, it becomes a question of simple math to determine the best course of action at a given moment. All else the same, the weapon that does the most damage should be what everybody in the world defaults to. All else the same, the strategy that prevents the most damage taken is the best. Math IS worldbuilding. 2. The Foundation of Game Design In real life, we can't fight against monsters and men-at-arms with shuriken and our bare fists. Reality dictates that those actions would likely result in our demise. However, in a game, we often find ourselves roleplaying something that isn't exactly realistic - such as a magician slinging fireballs at ogres. If we want to allow the full range of themes to be represented in a game, we need all of them to be on a fair playing field. There is no purpose to allowing \"Unarmed Strike\" as an action that accomplishes nothing and gets you killed, after all - but we decide the rules of this universe. We can make \"Unarmed Strike\" deal substantial damage, or have additional benefits that make their use reasonable. By setting the rules properly, what is feasible changes to match our desires. Whether what you desire is a good thing is a discussion for another day - let's focus on the hows. What players do is a combination of what they desire, and what the game rewards. Developers should set the rules to reward what they want to happen, and not reward what they don't. Ideally, the incentives should match what the players want to do. 3. The Foundations of Fairness and Creativity The incentive structure of a game like DnD usually comes in the form of power. More money and experience means bigger and more magical swords and fireballs, or more hirelings, etcetera. When you want a fair game for players to enjoy various themes and strategies, you must balance the power such that there is not a single overwhelmingly dominant strategy that is easily recognized by players. This is only fair; if you have multiple players, and one is given obviously inferior power, they may experience frustration or disengagement when they notice their impact on the game is insubstantial as a result. Fairness in a system of mathematics is fundamentally a question of mathematics. When the underlying math is neglected, and the rest of the game is built despite it, you will quickly find oddities. If you make \"Unarmed Strike\" deal 1 damage, and \"Longsword\" deal between 1 and 8, you should not be surprised when nobody will opt for \"Unarmed Strike\" under any circumstances. If there is a dominant strategy, and yet you still declare that most of the people in this world fight with fists instead of swords (all else equal), your world becomes less believable. From the math, the rest of the world-building should come naturally and without significant leaps of logic - If you declare something exists in this world, there should be a basis for it, and this basis almost always comes from the math. Balanced systems inherently foster deeper engagement. Players are more likely to invest their time into the mechanics of a game when they believe they will not be held back by deviating from superior strategies. By employing mathematical approaches to skill scaling, damage output, resource allocation, and character progression, players are free to choose options based on thematics, creativity, and their own desires without worrying about doing the math on behalf of the developers to make sure they are being dealt a fair hand. Everything I've stated so far may seem obvious, and even patronizing, but the reality is that most developers do not take this into consideration as much as they should. 4. The Willy Wonka World of DnD I'll spare you the fine details and skip to the important math to keep in mind. In DnD, there are listed weapons that are assumed to be available from character creation. If we consider the world in which this takes place, it would be fair to assume that the people in the world would also want to survive encounters when selecting their weaponry, and those weapons are boiled down to sets of numbers and tags to describe them. The most important number to a commoner with no bonuses to anything is the damage number - in a fight, the odds to succeed are highest by simply using the weapon with the highest damage. And yet, a dagger deals 2.5 damage, while a stick deals 3.5. If they use a very big stick, they can even reach 4.5, if they don't mind using both hands. If they spend some more money and actions, they can use two axes for a whopping 7 damage, and this is only with \"simple\" weapons they may be proficient in. The simple conclusion here is that, all else equal, a commoner's preferred weapon should be a stick, or two axes if they have money to spare. The stick is the most versatile, cheap, and powerful weapon available to them. Even if you take into account the bonuses from stats, a commoner would need maximum dexterity to consider a dagger, even compared to weapons they are not proficient in. In this world, using a dagger is mathematically inferior to every other option for any regular, non-player character. This results in a silly world that only suits the players, without taking into account the rest of the creatures. Why would a knife be a substantially worse weapon than a stick? A goat that attacks a human is likely to kill them in a single attack. How long would a farmer last in such a world? Some classes and builds can easily survive far longer and deal multiple times as much damage as others, often while being better at non-combat activities as well. Why would anyone willingly choose to be the inferior class if the objective is to survive? The expected earnings of a player far outpace the earnings of commoners, as untrained labor is only enough to pay for a gallon of ale or a stay at a poor inn while a single piece of basic equipment can be worth a hundred times as much. Is it really acceptable to put the price on a day of deadly work (such as a mercenary) equal to the price of a dagger, one of the worst items in the game, such that a player could hire dozens of them for every adventure? How long can you ride on a player's goodwill and desire for thematics and roleplay before these poor worldbuilding decisions start to interfere with their fantasy? The Defense of Flawed Mathematics One of the most insidious phenomena in the world of TTRPGs is the tendency of players to defend poor mathematics and imbalanced mechanics, often born out of a fundamental misunderstanding or intentional ignorance of underlying principles. This defense frequently stems from a place of trust in the developers and an emotional attachment to the game itself, leading players to uphold the perceived authority of the creators. 1. Trust in Authority \"If they wanted it that way, they would have made it that way!\" \"You think they didn't think of that? They clearly left it like that for a reason.\" \"Why don't you do better, then?\" When players encounter a system that is hailed as \"official,\" there is a natural inclination to assume that the developers have meticulously crafted every detail, and thus, their choices are unquestionable. Players may erroneously believe that since the developers designed the game, they must have considered every possible variable and outcome, rendering any criticism unwarranted. Players may also propagate the myth of developer infallibility, asserting that they are privy to unique insights that justify design decisions. Such attitudes not only inhibit constructive discourse, but they also diminish the validity of collective player experiences and insights, as an entire community’s lived experiences may be rendered irrelevant in the face of perceived expertise. The belief that there \"can’t be a better way\" is a common claim that started among video game developers, such as at Riot Games and Nexon, as they frequently cite data they claim exists to justify their actions while refusing to release said data to prove it. The truth is that no such data exists, and modern gaming communities can easily get access to or create superior data from which to make decisions. When confronted with suggestions for rebalance, players often leap to the defense of their cherished mechanics, positing that the developers \"must have had a reason\" for their choices. This blind and aggressive defense of the systems further perpetuates the cycle of flawed designs, as those advocating for improvement or merely offering their observations are dismissed as \"Powergamers,\" or told that they're just not focusing on what matters, and that roleplay trumps game design. Because the foundation of these defenses is inherently fallacious, they almost always lead to a statement that reveals their lack of engagement with the topic. The most common ones include that the game is made to be changed from table to table, that the suggestions are merely opinions and do not represent the needs of the community, that the opinions of those that are not part of successful gaming companies are inherently worthless, and basic attacks on the character of those criticizing the game (rather than focusing on the criticisms themselves). 2. Ignorance of Mathematical Foundations Most players lack the mathematical literacy necessary to fully grasp the implications of game mechanics at a detailed level. Consequently, when flaws in balance emerge—be they overpowered abilities, inefficient resource distribution, or underwhelming options—players may misinterpret these issues as subjective preferences rather than objective mathematical failings. The most common misinterpretation of the math is that of percentage reductions: Most players do not know that reducing an effect by 100% is far more than twice as good as reducing it by 50%. A common way this ignorance appears is in video games such as League of Legends, Minecraft, and Skyrim, where players will honestly believe that combining a reduction of 50% with another 50% and getting a result of 75% is somehow a \"diminished\" effect because the total did not reach 100%, when in reality the result is a multiplicative, mathematically accurate, and fair way to represent the effect. Combined with the aforementioned bias towards that which is \"official,\" a majority of the population will convince themselves that their intuitive (incorrect) understanding of the underlying mathematics is also aligned with what the developers think - and, unfortunately, they may be correct. 3. Ignorance of the Developers The methods used by the developers of DnD to create the game and the underlying math is transparently dubious. By their own (unwitting) admission, the top-down approaches used by them with a lack of emphasis on mechanics and math, insufficient player testing, and dismissal of community feedback has led to books full of wondrous descriptions of a game that does not accurately match their vision in practice. The examples of such are too numerous to list, but to bring up simultaneous examples that perfectly encapsulate the sheer nescience of the lead developers of DnD, we can look at the playtests of DnD 5.5. During the playtests, the developers made a particularly bizarre public video about the results, falsely claiming that a mechanic that players did not interact with was \"mathematically one of the most powerful\" when it was the worst on average, dismissing feedback because player scores on individual features were higher than the overall score, and even incorrectly referencing their own changes to their own content. What truly happened behind the scenes to cause such a public statement to be made without any proofreading is unclear. It's up to a given individual to review these actions to decide whether it's negligence, ignorance, or deliberate equivocation. I try taking the most charitable approach by assigning ignorance to what could have just as easily been malice. From Math, All Is Born Game developers must adopt a mathematical mindset in their approach. This includes rigorous playtesting with statistical analyses, iterative balancing, and a commitment to utilizing clear metrics for evaluating the effectiveness and fairness of mechanics while maintaining consistency and logic. Checking published content for faults should not be the burden of the players, especially when the product is advertised as being beginner-friendly. Disparities that can be encountered within a new player's first turn should not be tolerated, let alone upheld as intended design. Players should be involved in the balancing process, and even perceived faults in criticism should be thoroughly investigated to identify the underlying reasons for the criticisms being put forth. When a community is particularly large, there's a high likelihood that there will be individuals that practically design the game in its entirety in their criticisms. To dismiss them is the peak of hubris. When a game's fundamentals and mathematical foundations are made airtight, the content built on them will likewise be untouchable. Under ideal circumstances, even inexperienced players should be able to expand on the content in the game with little worry of diminishing the balance. I hope to one day live in a world where criticisms of game balance and mathematics are truly in the realm of the nitpicking and biased, and that all game discussion becomes that of themes and abstractions.",

      "content": "\"As someone who comes from D&D, another very customiseable game, the \"just fix it yourself\" mentality is so pervasive even though the whole reason we use a tabletop RPG SYSTEM is that it should minimise how much actual game design non-game designers (i.e. players) should be doing. The best example of people being forced into the \"game designer\" position (who really shouldn't have been) is this well known issue that it wasn't worth casting healing spells in combat because they healed so little compared to incoming damage. Healers, who also have potent offensive magic, would just let people get to zero HP, then resuscitate them right before their turn with the weakest, lowest commitment healing spell so they both at least get to do some damage before the injured person goes down from the next thing that breathes on them. This was called \"yo-yo healing\" because combat would become a whack-a-mole game of people going down, then up and down again. For some reason, it became really popular to punish going unconscious with debuffs. This is like seeing smoke and trying to fan it away while making the fire underneath worse. Great, now the situation you don't really have the tools to avoid now punishes you further. With such a terrible \"fix\" being so popular, clearly being a game designer isn't an easy, \"anyone can do it\" job. It takes years of experience to get good at it. Most people were unable to identify the root cause of \"yo-yo healing\", which was eventually correctly addressed as low healing output 10 years later by the actual game designers when they buffed healing magic. That being said, the average player, and even modder, likely isn't that great at even identifying WHY something is a problem or why something is causing them to have less fun. After I started playing with KeepInventory, I started feeling dissatisfied after a while of using death as a way to just get back to my spawn. I couldn't just eject the \"forbidden knowledge\" from my head. What I eventually realised is that I DID want death to have some kind of punishment, I just didn't want it to cause \"oh my god, I'm going to lose hours of progress!\" kind of panic. The real solution ended up being installing a gravestone mod so I still had to collect my death loot.\" @floofzykitty5072 May 2025",

They age about the same rate as humans do, but once they grow to size, they do not die of old age, nor do they get any health complications from old age. | | Appearance and Biology | Elves are lithe androgynous humanoids with long pointed ears as their most telling feature. In their youth, elves possess an eerie beauty, appearing as idealized and flawless beings in the eyes of humans. Most are light-skinned with green eyes, but they come in a variety of shades and hues that reflect the environments in which they were born.They become adults at about the same speed as humans, but when they grow older, they physically change based on things like their environment or their magical affinity instead of becoming wrinkled and feeble. Forest hermits might start growing leaves and branches, stag horns or feathers. A wizard that specializes in Cryomancy might turn a light shade of blue and grow cold to the touch. Changing in physical properties like these typically happen over the course of many years.Elves do not reproduce often due to a combination of low fertility, low libido, and cultural pressures due to their lifespan. Most elves can only conceive in the presence of natural magic, such as during celestial events or in blessed springs. Because of this, they are quite a rare sight outside of their settlements. | | Ageless | Elves are unique among humanoids due to their endless youth. They develop a very different perception of time and the world at large. While a generation of humans might pass every 20 years or so, a generation of elves often lasts over a century. As such, they have a unique perspective on the rise and fall of empires, world level crises, and the passage of time in general. Elves possess a unique form of wisdom that can either be used to aid other races, or cause them to become jaded as they see the same pattern of self destruction emerge multiple times amongst the humanoid societies they observe.Long life isn't all sunshine and rainbows. Elves can often develop a superiority complex, considering they are usually the smartest or wisest person in any given room. Yearly celebrations such as birthdays are largely ignored. Elves making friends with non elves is a rarity, since they won't stick around long enough to matter anyway. Elves can often seem apathetic towards the plights of other humanoids, but their reactions have merely been tempered by experience. Many will hide for the rest of eternity, minimizing the risks to their health until they feel there is something important enough to emerge for.Because elven society moves much more slowly than other humanoids, many of their practices can seem archaic, time-consuming and inconvenient. They are often purposefully designed to be so in order to make them take more time and be more inconvenient to replicate for other races. \"See you again soon\" takes on an entirely different meaning as the elf's perception of time is likely wildly different than what most non-elven creatures think. They tend to be much more conservative than others, adhering to ancient traditions and worshiping less popular or older deities. Everybody is a kid at some point, so they understand what it was like to some degree: What it is like to feel wonder in a world filled with the unknown. At some point people grow and the wonder and discovery of childhood is filled with responsibility and routine of adulthood. Elves eventually come to exist on some 3rd plateau of existence where they have eaten every food, vacationed in every country, saved the world, started a family, lost people they loved, turned to the dark side and were eventually redeemed and all the rest. Once you experience so much of what the world has to offer, once you have given so much of yourself to the world only to be forgotten, what is the meaning of your continued existence? | | Obsession | The aforementioned appearance changes are merely an outward representation of decades, maybe even centuries of obsession, and their effects on the individual's soul. When traditional methods of acquiring meaning in one's life fail, elves have all the time in the world to dedicate to their projects. Spiteful elves may eventually have their conscious eroded to the point where the short-lived races are viewed as mice in their experiments, and are transformed into monsters. They might develop an entirely selfless desire to protect the natural world and view most any inhabitants that exploit it as a virus to be cured by any means necessary. Maybe at a young age they are exposed to a great evil and tirelessly work to exterminate it, and snuff out any reemergence for as long as they live.Turning people into monsters is abhorrent, and hunting demons is noble. Protecting nature is a lofty ideal, but usually most humanoids are only willing to go as far is needed to maintain their way of life: Appeasing the spirits for safety, enriching the soil for crops etc. So a single-minded dedication to nature could easily cause conflict once one too many trees are cut. These exceptionally long-lived elves that develop obsessions don't necessarily cause conflict, but depending on their obsession, they very easily could. Entire elven societies form around these obsessions, for better or worse. | | The Princess Adventurer | Age causes the perception of elves to warp as they gain life experience, but elves in their youth have no such experience. Young elves are rebellious towards elven traditions in the same way children of other races are to their parents, as the reality of their immortality takes decades to set in. Young elves (usually between ages 20 and 100) are often hard to distinguish from humans in terms of personality archetypes. They are usually more reserved, but are otherwise capable of taking risks that older elves learn to avoid. They are the most likely to travel the world and engage in dangerous adventures. This is where the visage of the stereotypical elf comes from: stories of fair elven princesses leaving their homes to see the world, still retaining that eerie beauty of their youth while being the oldest among their peers.As they age, and the reality of their immortality sets in, young elves often regret the decisions they took in their rebellious years. Other races enjoy their lives while they have it, taking risks and making dumb decisions to make the best of it. Elves, on the other hand, will live long enough to regret their tattoos, their scars, and the enemies they made. \"Permanent\" means something very different to someone that will have to deal with the consequences of their actions for the next thousand years. |",

They often have additional luxurious fur on their necks and extremities, and dense voluminous hair. Usa look almost identical to their parents without fail, making lineage easy to identify.Almost all Usa are female or hermaphrodites with extreme fertility. Their ability to multiply is their main method of survival, and doing so comes as easily as breathing to them. This is paired with an innate aloof disposition and lack of self preservation. They often have so many offspring that they don't care to keep track of them, and the fear of death has less value to their survival than the desire to breed. | | Pest Control | Ancient Usa ancestors survived by minimizing their impact on their environments, hiding, and ensuring their children would live to see another day when the Links were being hunted to extinction.The most successful among them were the smallest, fastest, and most efficient kin. Hiding turned into predator satiation, and protecting children turned into sacrifice for the good of the group. After enough time, the Usa simply accepted that they were hunted for sport, and stopped worrying about minimizing their footprints. They unapologetically swarmed resources, knowing full well it made them easy to find.In modern times, Usa Half-Links are often still mercilessly hunted, as their overwhelming numbers can cause serious problems when their leadership figures don't have conservation on the mind. At the same time, this continued aggression from other races radicalizes the larger Usa clans, and retaliatory Usa uprisings have been known to tear countries apart in short-term conflicts.

However, most lineages have a maximum size of around 4', and weigh around 70 lbs. The most short-lived lineages grow incredibly rapidly until they reach maturity at 1, and then live until 20, or 35 with good health. The longer lifespans tend to reach maturity at 15, and then live until 100. | | Appearance and Biology | Many Half-Links have a gradient of form, ranging from mostly-animal or even completely feral to humanoids with minor aesthetics (such as ears and tail) or indistinguishable from other humanoids. However, many others have no control over their appearance, and are stuck in a middle ground between a particular humanoid race (usually human or elf) and their animal ancestry. Half-Links tend to be druids, barbarians, and other wild peoples as a consequence of their pasts, so most that are not integrated into civilization will wear pelts and plant matter, if anything at all. Half-Links that are integrated into society will tend to wear whatever culture they are closest to within that society to fit in. Half-Links tend to appear small, almost childlike in their youthful appearances, and tend towards being incredibly athletic and muscular in build. As they age, their humanoid parts still tend to remain young, but their animal aspects will wither and grey. | | Origins | The Half-Links originated from animals in the distant past. They were subject to an obscure, primordial phenomenon known as Primal Sentience. This rare occurrence grants random animals a spark of consciousness, later culminating in a high degree of intelligence and understanding of the world equal to a human, as well as physical abilities far beyond any other of their species.These creatures were initially viewed as malevolent entities, tricksters and puppet-things of spellcasters and demons through which harm was inflicted on crops and societies. These beliefs were founded on real events, as many of them appeared from the wilderness and preyed on livestock and children, or mimicked common speech to scare away or, rarely, converse with strangers that wandered into their territory.As time passed and understanding of these beings grew, powerful druidic circles took it upon themselves to cultivate their integration into society. They were able to seek and collect the rare animals and give them an opportunity to learn common speech, culture, and knowledge, and with that they were able to reach a level of proficiency in ability and magic similar to humanoid races. This was an incredible undertaking, requiring the hands of some of the most powerful individuals in the world, with the guidance of the gods above and below. The final step in their integration was a study of druidic magic. The same magic that allowed druids to shape change into animals was used by those magic animals to change into humanoids, giving them a nearly seamless transition into personhood as it was recognized by those around them. For a long time, their unique talents and perspectives put them at the forefront of magical research, entering civilization as part of the middle and upper class. They were then known as The Links. | | The Great Hunt and Devolution | While the Links changed culturally and physically as their descendants acclimated to living with the other races, the culture and tradition of the other races were far too slow to change. A backlash from those who still perceived the Links as abominations from deeply entrenched superstitions ultimately led to their widespread persecution. Entire crusades were established in opposition to their sudden rise to power, fueled by conspiracies built on folklore and disgust at the intermingling of Links and humanoids in an equal setting. In a blink of history, the Links and the druidic circles that helped them went from a well-established collection of powerful enclaves, to nothing. The relentless pursuit and slaughter of these individuals, generations of separation from their primal origins, enslavement, and the suppression of their innate magical abilities caused the total degeneration and extinction of the Links, resulting in the fragmented, diminished forms that exist today. Those who managed to evade this cataclysm were forced to isolate themselves, adopt human guise, or interbreed for survival, completing the final severing of ties with their ancestral heritage. Eventually, all that remained were the Half-Links; smaller, weaker, more mundane, and otherwise pathetic when compared to what they once were.The majority of modern Half-Links inherited but a fraction of their forebears' magical capacities, leading to the present-day diversity of tribes and the varied, often unstable, expression of their abilities. | | Tribal Lineages and Regional Variations | Fast-forward through now-ancient history, and specific Half-Link tribes have emerged, each with their own distinct characteristics, traditions, and magical inclinations. These tribes, often defined by their animalistic ancestry, reflect the divergent paths taken by various Half-Link ancestors. While some remain largely isolated, others have adapted to their environments and forged uneasy alliances with humanoid societies. To most, specific tribes of Half-Links are their own separate, unrelated race. Over time, many groups have carved out niches for themselves with the abilities they inherited, evolving into something completely unlike what their ancestors were. They created their own cultures and abilities in these offshoots, resulting in modern groups such as the Kitsune and Lamia. | | Never Again | Primal Sentience still exists.

Dwarves reach adulthood by 20 and live to be around 150. | | Appearance and Biology | Dwarves are universally \"male\" (genderless, but typically masculine). Rather than reproducing through traditional means, they go mining to find more Dwarves. Dwarves are a naturally occurring resource just like iron, and can be harvested as such. They usually appear inside of stony egg-like structures with the texture of hair. These eggs naturally form as a result of Dwarvic Energy, which is created through the act of mining. Dwarf eggs can only form in unworked stone, making it necessary to go far out from home to find them. More Dwarvic Energy is generated when dwarves mine, and Dwarves have a more keen sense when it comes to finding Dwarf eggs, making it uncommon for other humanoids to discover them. There are a handful of ways to hatch a Dwarf egg. Some use specific solvents like a shampoo to soften the protective outer beard shell while others warm it up and comb at it. When hatched, Dwarflings start off a bit more developed then birthed humanoids. With roughly a year head start, they can already move around on their own, eat most foods and understand basic physics. Dwarves are easily identifiable from their wide frames, short statures and incredible beards. They typically have a higher density of muscles and hair than most other humanoids. They take exceptional care of their facial hair, prioritizing it over the hair on the top of their head. Dwarves hatch with beards, so it is very rare to see one without a beard. Average Dwarves tend to be wary of beardless Dwarves. | | Vibe Check | Because Dwarves have completely different biology when it comes to reproducing, their family structure doesn't follow that of creatures that give birth to their own young. Instead, Dwarflings stick with whoever mined them during their early years. By the time they are teenagers, they can get a feel for their immediate family and decide whether or not they are a good fit for them. As such, Dwarves form families (called Brotherhoods) similar to how most people find friend groups. Dwarves who don’t click with the family they were hatched into will readily leave to go find people that share their ideals and lifestyle more closely. Dwarves that are part of a brotherhood share the same name, but are willing to drop it when they change or they think the brotherhood 'aint what it used to be. Dwarves who don't vibe with the local brotherhoods have a tendency to wander around the overworld until they find a nice craftsman or adventuring party to latch onto. Dwarves innately have a strong ability to read people, making this somewhat naïve approach to finding family more viable. However, just because a Dwarf is traveling doesn't automatically mean they aren't part of a brotherhood. Sometimes it is necessary to do business with surface dwellers. | | Round Up the Lads | Because Dwarves do not have genders, they are a lot less sensitive to the kinds of dynamics having sexual dimorphism causes in humanoids. It can take a bit of getting used to not bathing or taking a leak in the presence of ladies. Dwarves tend to treat women of other races just like the men. This comes with a whole host of problems, but it also comes with a few positives. Men and women having a Dwarven friend are likely to be at ease with any talk of romance or its implications, knowing their companion has no personal interest in the subject.Dwarves tend to express masculine ideals much more frequently. They enjoy one-upping each other when it comes to tests of strength, and especially tests of endurance. A favorite is the drinking contest, which most Dwarves will handily win. Unfortunately for suitors, they are also aromantic, making such advances made against them bounce harmlessly off of them. | | Secrets of the Dwarves | Larger brotherhoods or groups willing to cooperate can sometimes get up to some…Interesting shenanigans when it comes to experimentation on Dwarflings. Nearly everything related to the topic is a closely guarded secret, known only by a handful of elders in the brotherhood. Rumor has it that the Dwarves will use some arcane mining methods in order to increase the chances of Dwarflings appearing inside of rare metals like gold. These oddities are usually substantially different from the standard Dwarf, taking on some of the properties of the metal they form from. Golden Dwarves, a favorite amongst the Dwarven elite, tend to be softer, thinner, and more magically talented. There are even some rumors of Dwarfling eggs being used as part of the forging process in order to create metallic Dwarves. If such things do exist and are not just fantasy stories told by bards looking to capture the interest of the common folk, then they have never seen the light of day. |",

Even if certain actions have a skill associated with them, you don't necessarily need to roll a skill check (no need to roll Deception if they already believe you, no need to roll Athletics in still water, etc.) When one is required, it is prompted by the DM. If the DC to a task is more than 30 points higher than the bonus on the roll, then the DM should deem it impossible in cases where \"fishing\" for a success with no repercussions is the intent. The special roll allows rolling any number, so if a task is well out of a character's reach such that the DC difference is that high, it may be better to not allow the roll to preserve the narrative. This roll can be very swingy, creating dramatically unexpected results. As such, using a skill roll as a barrier for entry can create all or nothing scenarios. There's nothing wrong with saying \"the lock is too complex for you to pick,\" but you can't be upset when immediately after the martials of the party start smashing into the door. There should be lesser versions of success. If you barely fail the DC to scale a wall, it lowers your speed instead of falling. If you barely fail a Stealth check while trailing someone, they can tell someone is in the bushes, but not who. Many things should not be represented by a skill or ability roll. For example, do not roll to see if someone can lift a portcullis - This is already represented by their Carrying Capacity. You should also carefully consider what a roll represents, and whether rerolls are appropriate. When rolls are made, don't be surprised when the party's expert sometimes gets outdone by the party's pet chicken. A skill check should be summarized with a \"you can or you can't\" when rolling may cause inconsistencies. Skill bonuses are increased by one relevant Ability Score modifier. You add 2x the bonus to your skill check if you are Proficient. Proficiency in a skill grants you a 2+LV bonus to the skill. Certain aspects of a skill might only be available to characters that are proficient in the skill. Standard skill DCs are what should be used in the absence of a set or opposed DC. Remember that every 10 point difference makes the task twice as hard. They are as follows… | Difficulty | DC | | ----------------- | --- | | Mundane | 0 | | Requires Focus | 10 | | Trained | 20 | | Difficult | 30 | | Masterwork | 40 | | Nearly Impossible | 50 | | Ascended | 60 | Some skills are opposed to other skills, while other skills will include examples comparable this chart.",

Step 1: Add Icon to Your Note's Frontmatter At the very top of your file, add a special section called \"frontmatter\" with an line: The lines are important - they tell the system where the frontmatter starts and ends. Step 2: Save and Commit After you save your file: 1. Commit and push your changes to GitHub 2. The system automatically updates (GitHub Actions does this for you!) 3. Wait a minute for the deployment, then refresh your browser Step 3: Enjoy Your Icon! The icon will now appear: - ✨ Next to your note title in the left sidebar - ✨ In the page header when viewing the note - ✨ In any wiki-links that point to that note --- 📝 Using Icons Inside Your Content You can also use icons directly in your note content! Any time you create a wiki-link to another note, if that note has an icon, it will automatically appear next to the link. Example: If \"Dragon Lore\" has in its frontmatter, the dragon icon will appear automatically next to the link! No extra work needed. --- 🔍 Where to Find Icons You have access to over 200,000 icons from 150+ icon libraries! Here are the best places to browse: 🎮 Game Icons (Best for D&D/RPG content!) 4,000+ fantasy, medieval, and gaming icons - this is your go-to for RPG content! - Browse all Game Icons: https://game-icons.net/ - Search on Iconify: https://icon-sets.iconify.design/game-icons/ Examples: Dragons, swords, spells, dice, shields, potions, scrolls, monsters ✨ Lucide Icons (Best for simple concepts) Clean, modern icons - great for abstract ideas and UI elements - Browse Lucide: https://lucide.dev/icons/ - Search on Iconify: https://icon-sets.iconify.design/lucide/ Examples: Heart, brain, eye, sparkles, clock, target 🔷 Font Awesome (General purpose) Huge variety - good for common objects and concepts - Browse Font Awesome: https://fontawesome.com/icons - Search on Iconify: https://icon-sets.iconify.design/fa6-solid/ 🔎 Search ALL Icons Not sure which library to use? Search everything at once: Main Search: https://icon-sets.iconify.design/ Just type what you're looking for (like \"dragon\" or \"sword\") and browse the results! --- 📝 How to Write Icon Names Icon names have two parts: a prefix (which library) + the icon name. The Magic Formula PascalCase means: CapitalizeTheFirstLetterOfEachWord Common Prefixes (What You'll Use Most) | Prefix | Library | Use For | |--------|---------|---------| | | Game Icons | ⭐ RPG/D&D stuff (use this most!) | | | Lucide | Simple concepts (heart, brain, eye) | | | Font Awesome | General items | | | Heroicons | Modern UI icons | There are 20+ more libraries available - but these four cover 95% of what you'll need! 🎯 Converting Icon Names (The Easy Way) When you find an icon on a website, the name usually has hyphens (like ). Here's how to convert it: Step 1: Look at which library it's from - Game Icons → Use - Lucide → Use - Font Awesome → Use Step 2: Convert the icon name to PascalCase - Remove all hyphens and spaces - Capitalize the first letter of each word Examples: | Website Shows | You Write | |---------------|-----------| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 💡 Pro Tip: The System is Smart! Don't worry too much about getting the prefix exactly right - the system automatically tries multiple icon libraries if it can't find your icon in the first one. So if you write but that icon doesn't exist in Ionicons, it'll automatically try Game Icons, Lucide, Font Awesome, and others until it finds a match! Just focus on getting the icon name close, and the system will help you out. --- 📖 Complete Example Here's a complete note with an icon and wiki-links: What happens: - 🔥 The fireball icon appears in the sidebar next to \"Fireball Spell\" - 🔥 The icon shows in the page header when you view this note - 🔥 Any wiki-links to this note will show the icon automatically - If \"Evocation\", \"Fire Damage\", and \"Spell Casting\" have their own icons, those will appear next to their links too! --- ❓ Troubleshooting My Icon Isn't Showing - Help! Most Common Issues: 1. Check your frontmatter format 2. Check your icon name 3. Does the icon actually exist? - Go to https://icon-sets.iconify.design/ - Search for your icon name - If you can't find it, try a different search term or similar icon 4. Did you commit and push your changes? - After adding icons, commit and push to GitHub - GitHub Actions automatically updates the system - Wait a minute for deployment, then refresh your browser (Ctrl + F5) Still Not Working? Try these steps: 1. Make sure you committed and pushed your changes to GitHub 2. Check that GitHub Actions completed successfully (green checkmark) 3. Wait a minute or two for the deployment to finish 4. Do a hard refresh: Ctrl + F5 (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac) 5. If still not working, check the browser console for error messages (F12 → Console tab) The system will automatically try different icon libraries if the first one doesn't work, so don't worry too much about getting the prefix perfect! --- 🌟 Icon Cheat Sheet for D&D/RPG Content Copy and paste these directly into your notes! ⚔️ Character Classes 📊 Ability Scores 💥 Damage Types 🎒 Equipment Categories 🎲 Game Mechanics 🐉 Creature Types --- 💡 Quick Tips Finding the Perfect Icon 1.
