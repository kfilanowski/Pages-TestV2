Plant creatures are made of plant matter. This group also encompasses Fungi. This group ranges from towering treants to carnivorous vines to networks of mycelium, but typically show off a high degree of symbiosis and adaptation to their environment and local creatures. It is often difficult to tell friend from foe apart in this group, as an unidentified pod could just as easily be a source of food as it could be a lure into a pit of thorny vines.
