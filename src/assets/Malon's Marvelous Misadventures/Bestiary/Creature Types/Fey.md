Fey are whimsical nature-bound creatures that live on the border between fantasy and reality. Many appear dreamlike or nightmarish, or like the results of hallucinations, often with nonsensical anatomy and far too many colors.

Fey tend to serve mundane, but otherwise natural purposes in the world, such as the spread or cleansing of disease. Some represent concepts or ideas that are otherwise neutral, such as fey of happiness, sadness, marriage, censorship, and flavor.

Fey cultures often appear whimsical and mischievous, contrasting sharply with the more straightforward attitudes and behaviors of humanoid cultures.
