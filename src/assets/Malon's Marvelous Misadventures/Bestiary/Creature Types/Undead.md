Undead are souls wearing flesh that no longer lives, powered by foul magic that binds spirits into servitude beyond death. Respect for the dead in many cultures comes from experience of what happens when the dead are desecrated, as lynching, mass murders, fires, and other horrific deaths where the death is not properly honored can result in the creation of naturally-occurring undead.

Undead created naturally typically have unfinished business, obsessions, or grudges against those that wronged them. They are often lucid of the facts surrounding their demise, and do everything in their power to correct their qualms - after which they must be put to rest.

Undead created by outside forces are constantly suffering a cruel fate, forced to live in broken bodies and without a will of their own. Casters that engage in this magic must be wary, as every day that passes runs the risk of letting the latent memories in these spirits manifest into wills of their own with their only desire being to destroy the caster that enslaved them. In the same vein, a caster that respects the wishes of a created undead can use their unfinished desires to their advantage, using alliances over enslavement to form lasting bonds until they are put to rest.
