Abominations are terrors born from the unknowable and the otherworldly. They cannot be reasoned with. They are utterly insurmountable nightmares that humanity has no hope of escaping.

From the darkest depths of space, the ocean and other mysterious realms, aberrations are often alien creatures uninterested in the conventions of traditional life. Others are strange mixes of the organic and inorganic in unfamiliar animalistic shapes.

Abominations are characterized by organized domination, horrific departures from traditional violence, hiveminds, and eerie motives.
