Celestials are the creatures from higher planes, all which serve a specific purpose towards furthering the order of the universe. They range from Angels, divine messengers of holy gods that aid in the fights against chaos, to [[Inevitable|Inevitables]], single-minded beings that enforce the laws of the universe and root out those that try to break them. Creatures in this group tend to respect and bargain with others in the same group, as they all have similar goals. An Angel may bargain with Death to reincarnate a necessary ally, or consult with an Inevitable to learn of how to stop a reality-warping ritual. All Celestials are [[Extraplanar]].
