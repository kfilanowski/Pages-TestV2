Oozemorphs are amorphous creatures that are biological in nature. Despite their apparent homogeneity, they are equipped with many of the same faculties as other living creatures, such as membranes, means of digestion, and ways to detect and react to stimuli. They are usually mindless, taking on the roles of dangerous traps and hazards to catch and devour unsuspecting victims. Intelligent Oozes are more active, often using their durability and physical properties to overwhelm their victims.
