Labor is the work required to [[crafting|Craft]] an item. It determines the time it takes to complete an item, and is calculated by subtracting the cost of [[Resources]] and [[Mana Crystal|Mana Crystals]] from the item's total value.
Labor is provided by all creatures participating in the crafting process. Each creature's Profession bonus is used as per [[Economics]] to determine how much they contribute to the craft. 

For example, if creating a special Armor requires 2000g of Labor, it would take a creature with a +5 bonus (65g per day) about 31 days to craft alone.
