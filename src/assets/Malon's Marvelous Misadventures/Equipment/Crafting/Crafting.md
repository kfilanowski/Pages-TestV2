Crafting is the use of specific Profession skills to create items.

In terms of gameplay, Crafting rewards players that use Resources gained in their adventures with a more efficient use of those resources. As an example, a flaming dragon hide that is normally worth 10000g might normally only sell for 5000g (as items only sell for half of their value by default), but is worth its full 10000g when used to Craft an appropriate item with it. It is also useful for acquiring items when there is no civilization from which to purchase them.

Most crafting is done with 3 components: [[Resources]], [[Mana Crystal]], and [[Labor]].

When deciding to Craft an item, first determine how much of the item's value will be provided in Resources, how much will be Mana, and how much will be Labor. We will be using the [[Cleaving Axe]] as an example.

Typically, half of an item's value is Resources, such as metals or special Loot. Non-magical items can have up to 75% of their value in Resources, while magic items can have as little as 25%. Unless specified on the item, players are free to choose how much value they want to assign to Resources within these bounds.
A Cleaving Axe is worth 2000g, so let's assume in this case we want to minimize the time to craft, and assign 75% of its value in Resources. A Cleaving Axe only requires metal to be crafted. That means we need to have or buy 1500g of metal, and reduces the remaining value to 500g.

A Cleaving Axe requires 1 Mana to craft. Any player can easily afford to sacrifice 1 Mana at some point during the crafting process to satisfy this requirement. This reduces the remaining value to 495g.

The player then needs to provide labor to complete the process. The Labor provided must be done using a Profession skill that is related to the item being crafted, such as [[Cooking]] for [[Food]], or Weaponsmith for a [[Weapon]]. 
Let's assume the player has a +10 bonus in their Profession: Weaponsmith skill. By [[Economics]] rules, they can complete 140g of value per day. This means it would take them 495/140 = 3.5 days of work to craft this item. If they had a friend with a related profession, they could assist too, and speed up the Labor process.
