Resources are items that can be used for [[Crafting]] that are sensibly related to the item being crafted. For example, flaming dragon hide may be useful for crafting flame-resistant armor, but not for crafting ice staves or crossbows.

They are most often acquired through using [[Butcher]] to acquire parts from creatures, or as [[Loot]].
