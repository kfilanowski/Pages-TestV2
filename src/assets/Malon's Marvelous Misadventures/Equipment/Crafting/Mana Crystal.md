Mana Crystals are a physical manifestation of [[Mana]] used for [[Crafting]] and [[Ritual|Rituals]]. They represent the power of populations, and are usually not readily available for direct purchase. One Mana is worth 5g when Crafting.

When Crafting, whoever is providing the Labor can Mana Burn to add an equal amount to their product to meet its Mana Crystal requirement. Most Mundane items have almost no Mana requirements, but Magic Items tend to have substantial amounts, and powerful Magic Items and Rituals tend to require exorbitant amounts of Mana.

The purpose of Mana Crystal requirements is to give innate value to populations and followership. Churches and kingdoms will establish donation sites to accumulate the power of their people, and will be unwilling to share those resources with just anyone. Those that have access to Mana have access to power in the world. Nobody can easily create powerful artifacts alone. See [[Mana Donation]].

Players that cannot reasonably meet Mana Crystal requirements should ally themselves with such organizations to gain access to their supplies, or establish a followership or church of their own.
