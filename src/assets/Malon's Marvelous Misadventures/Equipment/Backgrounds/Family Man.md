You are the primary owner of a house somewhere in the world, usually at least on the tangent of civilization. You lived with either your immediate family, like parents and siblings, or you made a family of your own with a spouse and children.

You own a meager house in a specific place, and a handful of family members to come home to after an adventure. Your house is always considered a suitable place to rest in order to cure general afflictions.
