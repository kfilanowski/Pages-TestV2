Settlements receive classifications based on population. More populous settlements tend to condense more wealth, have more facilities and are more cosmopolitan. Expensive or luxurious services can be expected in larger settlements, but are unheard of in smaller ones.

Hamlet - <1,000 people

Village - 1,000+ people

City - 10,000+ people

Metropolis - 100k+ people

Some general assumptions about a given population:

- About 10% of the population is assumed to be over level 0, with a skew towards early levels.

- Most regions have a dominant religion, with at around half the population favoring them. Metropolises tend to have more variety, while hamlets tend to be entirely dominated by a single religion.
