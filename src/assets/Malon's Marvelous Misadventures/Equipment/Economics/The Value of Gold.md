Estimating the true value of a single unit of currency is difficult to do when considering the possibilities of every setting. However, in order to establish some reference for pricing adventuring gear and items, we have to settle on one - so, for the purposes of the default pricing and earnings, we're going forward with the assumption that the differences between the peasants, tradesmen, and aristocrats is large, but not in such a way that compromises the ability of the peasantry to afford basic items.

As a fantasy setting with swords and monsters, there are comparisons to be made to the value of labor in the medieval era. However, in order to avoid mixing the complexities of medieval economics with magic and superheroes to an audience that may not have studied such, the gap between the peasants and aristocrats is reduced, and social mobility is substantially increased.
If a more extreme economy is desired, adjust the earnings from [[Economics]] and [[The Cost of Living]].

Average laborers like farmers can be expected to make ~10-20k gold every year, with the amount increasing with more sophisticated trades such as smiths or merchants.

Gold pieces are small coins and are virtually weightless due to the minting process performed by the financial wizards. Another benefit of this minting is that it causes gold pieces to naturally stack into specific values (5, 10, 20, 100, 1000). Someone can easily hold 100g in their pockets, or 1000g in a dedicated pouch. Anything more and they are bursting at the seams and would be better off with a bank, or to switch to alternative methods of payment.

Carrying around a bag of 100,000g would be like the real-world equivalent of carrying around a several briefcases full of paper currency. While this may happen for large transactions or when hauling away a dragon's horde, it's usually difficult to avoid drawing attention if you were to do it on the regular.

When imagining gold costs, use the following:

| Item Rarity | Cost Range | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cheap       | 1-100g     | Items used for regular, day-to-day activities fall in this category. Food, clothing, a stay at an inn, or common alchemy or building materials fall in this range. The lower end is comprised of items like bread, candy, and clothing, while the high end may be specialized items like light weaponry, trade tools, and padlocks.                   |
| Common      | 101-1k     | Common items are generally purchased less often than cheap ones by most. On the low end you get something like a furnace installation for a house, a med kit, minor potions, or a fancy outfit, and on the high end you get heavy armors, wagons, and masterwork weaponry.                                                                            |
| Expensive   | 1k-25k     | Expensive items must be saved up for by most common folk. These include long-distance travel vehicles, the average magic item and goods made with rare metals. On the low end you get good deals on failed magic items, high quality potions, and upgrade scrolls. On the high end you get something like a cannon, a sailing ship, or a meager home. |
| Rare        | 25k-250k   | Rare items are usually reserved for the rich, or require loans, savings, or groups to pool funds to purchase. This includes houses, battleships, and masterfully crafted items that have been upgraded substantially.                                                                                                                                 |
| Unique      | 250k+      | Large construction projects, ancient tomes of secrets, coveted legendary equipment, and expenses that are usually only sustainable by an entire town's contributions lie here.                                                                                                                                                                        |
