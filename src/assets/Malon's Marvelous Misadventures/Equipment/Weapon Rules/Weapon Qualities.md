Weapon Qualities describe what a [[Weapon]] does beyond its classification, [[Damage]], and [[AS]].

| Quality                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Bonus (+X)                             | This will be written as a specific [[Combat Maneuver]], [[Skill]] check, or [[Attack]] type, and X will be the bonus to it. You add this bonus when performing the associated [[Roll]] with the weapon. <br>[[Dual Wielding]] allows the application and stacking of this passive bonus within reason - A trip weapon can be used in conjunction with another, but a Hands weapon will not let you conceal your second weapon any better. |
| Reach                                  | Weapon can be used 5 ft farther. This doesn't change your natural [[Size and Reach\|Reach]]; all uses of this bonus reach must be through the weapon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
