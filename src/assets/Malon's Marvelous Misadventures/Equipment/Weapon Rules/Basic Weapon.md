Basic Weapons are the default [[Weapon|Weapons]] of a [[Weapon Group]]. They represent the effectiveness of common or makeshift weaponry. They have no [[Upgrade Slot|Upgrade Slots]], and come with the fewest amount of [[Weapon Qualities]].

Basic Weapons are the bare minimum afforded to arm common foot soldiers, or an adventurer in a pinch. Most people of note will quickly move on to better equipment.

When in doubt, assume the following as the standard:
