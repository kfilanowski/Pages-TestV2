Ammunition is a subtype [[Weapon Group]]. All Ammunition is either also part of another Weapon Group, or does not function as a weapon on its own.
These represent arrows, bolts, rocks, bullets, darts, or any other weapon that is either part of another weapon's use, or that is meant to be launched by itself in quick succession.

~={orange}Ammunition can be drawn as an [[Instant Action]]. 
Ammunition and its price and weight represent an unlimited source. You cannot easily "share" or otherwise split Ammunition between allies. You either have the ammunition or you don't - Exceptions can be made in the heat of combat, such as firing back an arrow that just hit a tree next to you.
