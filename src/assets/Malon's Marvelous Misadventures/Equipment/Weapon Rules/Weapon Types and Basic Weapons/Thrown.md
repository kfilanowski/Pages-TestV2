Thrown weapons are a group of [[Weapon|Weapons]] that are almost always 1-handed. 
These are weapons designed to be thrown using a swing from the hand or sling. Casters are armored gauntlets with thrown ammunition stored inside, used to draw and throw faster and harder. Many Thrown weapons are also [[Ammunition]].

The following are the [[Basic Weapon|Basic Weapons]] in the Thrown group.
