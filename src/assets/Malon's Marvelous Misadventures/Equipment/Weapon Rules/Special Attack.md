Special Attacks are qualities that a [[Weapon]] can have that temporarily grant you a [[Technique]]-like ability as long as you wield them. See [[Class and Weapon Abilities]]. You must use the weapon when performing the Special Attack. As per the [[Mana]] rules, you cannot sacrifice your own Mana to get another use of a [[Limited]] [[Innate Technique]] unless otherwise stated.
Special Attacks uses are also tied to the weapon - If you use the Special Attack, you cannot pass the weapon off to another creature to use it again, and the weapon has its own [[Recharge]] timer. This means you can't take the Recharge action and then pass it off to another creature to use their own Recharge.
