Weapons are the most basic method of increasing one's offensive power. Just having a weapon and attacking an enemy is often enough to make you a substantial threat, regardless of your expertise or abilities.

Weapons fall into [[Weapon Group|Weapon Groups]] for the purpose of identifying what [[Special Attack|Special Attacks]], Abilities, and [[Technique|Techniques]] they're compatible with. The categories describe how they are used to attack, rather than how they look. If a weapon has more than one main category, then that means its category changes based on the way it is used, such as throwing a dagger instead of swinging it.

There are ten main categories:

| Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Axe]]           | Can be 1-handed or 2-handed. <br>Weapons made to cut or pierce using chopping motions.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Blade]]         | Can be 1-handed or 2-handed. <br>Blades meant for slicing and stabbing, relying on the blade to do the cutting with a mere touch rather than chopping or committed thrusts.                                                                               |
| [[Bludgeon]]      | Can be 1-handed or 2-handed. <br>Bludgeons to beat the snot out of enemies in the most primitive way possible.                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Bow]]           | Always 2-handed. <br>Curved weapons held at the ends by taut or resistant elastic strings used for firing ammunition with a drawing motion.                                                                                                               |
| [[Close]]         | Always "1-handed." <br>Punches, kicks, claws, and headbutts that can be used in the closest of combat, even when pinned. These attacks can be with one's own natural weapons, or with weapons augmenting limbs.                                           |
| [[Dagger]]        | Always 1-handed. <br>Short, sharp weapons for getting close to enemies and striking weak spots or overwhelming them with angles of attack.                                                                                                                |
| [[Polearm]]       | Always 2-handed. <br>Long skirmish weapons for battlefield versatility. They combine the spacing of spears with the swings of axes. Often used to hook enemies in addition to being general weapons.                                                      |
| [[Thrown]]/Caster | Almost always 1-handed. <br>Weapons designed to be thrown using a swing from the hand or sling. Casters are armored gauntlets with thrown ammunition stored inside, used to draw and throw faster and harder.                                             |
| [[Thrust]]        | Can be 1-handed or 2-handed. <br>Blades and spears meant for dedicated thrusts to put enormous pressure at a single point. Often used to outrange and lunge at opponents.                                                                                 |
| [[Trigger]]       | Can be 1-handed or 2-handed. <br>Weapons with handles that are loaded beforehand and then fire their ammunition with a trigger. <br>~={orange}Trigger weapons require an [[Action-Attack]] to reload. <br>Trigger weapons do not add [[STR]] to damage.=~ |
And 4 subtypes:

| Type               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Ammunition]]     | Arrows, bolts, rocks, bullets, darts, or any other weapon that is either part of another weapon's use, or that is meant to be launched by itself in quick succession. This can also be a main group.<br><br>~={orange}Ammunition can be drawn as an [[Instant Action]]. <br>Ammunition and its price and weight represent an unlimited source. You cannot easily "share" or otherwise split Ammunition between allies. You either have the ammunition or you don't - Exceptions can be made in the heat of combat, such as firing back an arrow that just hit a tree next to you.=~ |
| [[Natural Weapon]] | Weapons that are part of a creature's being. Examples include claws, fists, tails, horns, stingers, and tentacles. <br>Most natural weapons are not universal, meaning they are different for each creature that has them and will be noted as such in their stat block. However, they do follow common trends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Shield]]         | These weapons are also shields.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Staff]]          | These weapons qualify for completing the Staff component of spells, and may have additional statistics as a result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
[[Exotic Weapon|Exotic Weapons]] do not neatly fit into these categories, and will list how they differ.

Weapons come with damage values, attack speed values, and damage types as their core stats, in addition to the categories listed above.

All standard weapons deal a physical [[Damage]] type. ~={orange}If a weapon has more than one damage type, you can decide which to use before you make a given attack with it.=~

Damage values and [[AS|Attack Speed]] correlate such that the damage tends to be very similar without any additional abilities or [[STR]]. The typical offense-oriented damage values and AS are as follows:

| Speed | Damage | Use                                                                                                   |
| ----- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5     | d4     | Best used with higher stats, [[On-Hit Effect\|On-Hit Effects]], or in conjunction with other actions. |
| 4     | d6     | Most versatile.                                                                                       |
| 3     | d10    | Middle-ground option for one-handed uses and [[Dual Wielding]].                                       |
| 2     | 2d8    | Best value with bonus attacks and [[Techniques]].                                                     |
Weapons with ranged capabilities (thrown or otherwise) will also have a listed range. Ranges come in an X/Y format, with the X range being the accurate range, and the Y taking a -4 penalty, referred to as the [[Range]].

| Range Category | Value  |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Thrown         | 20/40  |
| Short          | 40/60  |
| Long           | 60/120 |
Some weapons come with [[Technique|Techniques]] and [[Special Attack|Special Attacks]]. These temporarily grant you a technique as long as you wield them. As per the [[Mana]] rules, you cannot sacrifice your own Mana to get another use of a Limited Technique unless otherwise stated.
Special Attacks specifically are also tied to the weapon - If you use the Special Attack, you cannot pass the weapon off to another creature to use it again, and the weapon has its own Recharge timer.

Many weapons come with [[Weapon Qualities]]. These describe what a weapon does beyond its classification, Damage, and AS.

Unless otherwise stated, Weapons weights default to the following:

| Group                                                           | Weight |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Close, Dagger, 1h Blade, Sword-Like 1h Thrust weapons           | 2      |
| 1h Axe/Crush/Thrust, Bow                                        | 5      |
| 2h Axe/Blade/Crush/Thrust, Ammunition, Caster, Polearm, Trigger | 10     |
