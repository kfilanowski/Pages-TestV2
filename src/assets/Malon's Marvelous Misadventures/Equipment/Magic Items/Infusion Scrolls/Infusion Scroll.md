An Infusion Scroll can be used on an item's Upgrade Slot to apply a numeric bonus to its statistics, or add additional effects. They are a cheaper, but often more random alternative to upgrading via [[Enchanting]].

A given Infusion Scroll will specify what items it can be used on. Many infusion scrolls provide random bonuses.
