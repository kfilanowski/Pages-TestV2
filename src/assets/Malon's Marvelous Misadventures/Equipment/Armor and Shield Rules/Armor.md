Armors of varying weights have [[STR]] requirements, granting more AC at higher values. You lose 10 [[Speed]] and [[Jump]] for every point of STR you lack (minimum 5). Armor takes the Armor [[Equipment Slot]]. 
The following are the three most simple and common forms of armor. Light armor consists of hard leathers and gambesons, medium armor includes chain and scales with breastplates, and heavy armor covers every part of the body with a combination of plate, chain, and gambesons.

| Armor Class  | [[AC]] | Weight | STR Required |                |
| ------------ | ------ | ------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| Light Armor  | 1      | 10     | +0           |                |
| Medium Armor | 3      | 25     | +1           |                |
| Heavy Armor  | 5      | 50     | +2           | -4 [[Stealth]] |
