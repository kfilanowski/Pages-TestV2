Shields are a subtype [[Weapon Group]]. Not all shields can be used as weapons, however.
Shields are primarily used to gain defensive abilities to use as [[Action System|Actions]], and most also passively increase your defenses (Mainly [[AC]]). Many shields have minimum [[STR]] requirements just like [[Armor]], which penalize you in the same manner.
Unless otherwise stated, shields are 1-handed.

The following are the basic shields.

| Type         | AC  | Weight | Str | Abilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
