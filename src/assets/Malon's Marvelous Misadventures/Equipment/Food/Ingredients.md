Ingredients are used to create [[Food]] items, for those that want to get the most out of the [[Cooking]] skill. They are usually acquired from [[Forage|Foraging]] or as [[Loot]]. Some Ingredients are also Food - mainly ones that restore HP.

Ingredients are categorized into ten basic groups, and a Food item must be made with ingredients from different groups. There are 10 basic Ingredient groups from which most other Food is derived.

| Ingredient | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Egg        | A shelled or membranous object containing a creature's embryo and a yolk.                                                     |
| Fungus     | Mushrooms, molds, yeasts, and other non-plant organisms that grow on organic matter.                                          |
| Grain      | Seeds or similar vegetable matter, particularly ones that can be turned into Flour.                                           |
| Large Meat | Large portions of muscle tissue taken from a large animal. Smaller animals, such as mundane rodents, only qualify as Protein. |
| Milk       | Any liquid produced by a creature to feed its young, particularly from mammals.                                               |
| Oil        | Hydrophobic liquids pressed from energy-dense organic matter, such as seeds or fat.                                           |
| Protein    | Any small meats or legumes that can be used to supplement dietary needs for muscle growth.                                    |
| Roots      | Hard and typically woody energy-dense organic matter taken from the roots of plants, such as tubers.                          |
| Sugar      | Fruits, honey, and other sweet items.                                                                                         |
| Vegetable  | Edible plant matter that does not fall into the Grain or Roots categories, typically leafy greens or stalks.                  |

If a creature does not specify that it drops any Ingredients, it can still be harvested using [[Butcher]] to acquire some if it is organic.

Ingredients almost always make up a majority of a Food's value. Players should provide this value with roughly equal amounts of each Ingredient group. However, some leeway should be given to not overly restrict the cooking process and slow down gameplay.
