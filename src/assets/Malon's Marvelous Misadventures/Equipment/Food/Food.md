Food is one of the most common and necessary consumable resources to survive difficult journeys and dangerous dungeons. It is the slower, more efficient alternative to [[Potion|Potions]], which may grant their benefits briefly or in smaller amounts at a moment's notice.

It is assumed all food items are portioned properly as a meal, and cooked to preserve. They never spoil as long as they are handled properly and are not damaged directly, such as by fire. Perishable [[Ingredients]] will spoil unless cooked.

Food is consumed during a [[Short Rest]] over 15 minutes, unless otherwise stated.

Food primarily restores [[HP]], but may grant bonus effects until you eat again or [[Long Rest]].

The value of a particular food increases with how much it heals, what it grants, and how little it weighs. Because of how varied food can be, its value will often lead to haggling - however, at the very least, any such item will be worth more than its components.

The creation of food requires two or more [[Ingredients]], time, and skill. See [[Cooking]] and [[Crafting]] for more details.

The following are some basic examples of food:
