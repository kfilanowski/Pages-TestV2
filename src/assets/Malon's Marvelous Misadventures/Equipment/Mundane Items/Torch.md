10g [[Mundane Item]]

Torches are sticks wrapped with some type of cloth, chemical or vegetable matter that is flammable. Torches give off bright light in a 20 ft radius around them, and dim light 20 ft past that.

They can stay lit for up to 2 hours. Lighting and dimming a torch repeatedly can significantly decrease the amount of time they stay lit.

If a torch ends up getting wet, it becomes unusable.
