80g [[Mundane Item]]

Tools typically come in sets catered to a specific task, such as fishing or medicine. Some tasks require the use of tools, others only give a penalty if you don't have tools.

Tools also come in a masterwork variety, giving the user a +4 bonus on the skill in question. The price is increased to 800g.

~={red}Some tasks do not have associated tools, and therefore are not suitable for acquiring masterwork variants to them. Skills like medicine, alchemy and profession use tools. Skills like stealth, perception and persuasion do not. Some types of tools might be able to _aid_ you with novel types of tasks, such as using a spyglass to roll perception long distances, but should not give any types of persistent flat bonuses.=~

Most tool kits weigh 10 lbs. Some tasks, such as smithing, require even more advanced tools you can't carry around, such as a forge.
