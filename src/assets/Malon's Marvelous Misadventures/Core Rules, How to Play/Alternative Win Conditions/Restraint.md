When creatures don't surrender, but you don’t want to risk killing them, restraints can be used to end the fight. Some situations can naturally be neutralized by dropping a cage in the right place, but such conveniences are rare. More often than not, restraining your foe is going to involves rope and cuffs.

#Cuffs

Grabbing and already-grabbed creature allows you to put cuffs on them.

One grab is needed per appendage cuffed. You cannot cuff a creature on your own unless you can grab multiple times per turn, in which case you need another free hand. This provokes AoO.

This completely prevents the use of their arms outside of simple item interactions. Cuffs can also be placed on the legs to reduce a creatures speed to 15. Combat maneuvers made against a cuffed creature gain a +10 bonus.

Cuffs are difficult to escape, and even harder to break. They typically require outside assistance in order to be removed. Because cuffs are typically made from iron and steel, they can take a significant beating.

DC to break (Athletics) or lockpick (Hands) is dependent on the type of material and the lock. A typical forged cuff is DC 40 to break, or 20 to pick.

Creatures that are bound can try to free themselves, but take a -5 penalty.

#Rope

Grabbing and already-grabbed creature allows you to tie them with rope.

One grab is needed per appendage tied. You cannot tie up a creature on your own unless you can grab multiple times per turn, in which case you need another free hand. This provokes AoO.

Rope is easier to destroy than cuffs, but it is also easier to make the restraint more intense. By grabbing one more time, you can prevent the creature from acting completely.

Rope tends to be a good way to bind singular creatures, since anybody with a sharp implement can handily free a bound creature.

Rope can be destroyed with an attack from any slashing weapon. Using Athletics or Acrobatics, you can pull the ropes apart, but the DC is determined by the athletics bonus of the creature who bound you (30+their athletics bonus). Creatures that are bound can try to free themselves, but take a -5 penalty. This penalty can be ignored with a natural attack suitable for freeing yourself, or a slashing concealed weapon.

#Container

Grabbing and already-grabbed creature allows you to forcefully shove them into an object within reach such as a bag, barrel, or box, so long as they can handily fit in the object.

Whether or not they can escape generally depends on the object and the tools the captured creature has on hand. Wooden crates don’t do to well when trying to hold barbarians or crafty characters with crowbars.

DC to break (Athletics) is dependent on the type of material. Some objects can be handily dealt with, not requiring a skill check. A knife makes quick work of a bag, and given enough space, hammers break boxes.

Creatures that are bound can try to free themselves, but take a -5 penalty.
