These are representations of a creature's innate or cultivated affinities. These represent the mind, body, and spirit. The ability scores are [[STR|Strength]], [[DEX|Dexterity]], [[LUK|Luck]], [[INT|Intelligence]], [[WIS|Wisdom]], and [[CHA|Charisma]].

Every [[PC|Player Character]] gets 3 points to increase their ability scores as they wish, starting from 0 in each.

You can decrease a single ability score to -1 in order to gain an additional point. The maximum points you can invest in a given ability score is 2.
