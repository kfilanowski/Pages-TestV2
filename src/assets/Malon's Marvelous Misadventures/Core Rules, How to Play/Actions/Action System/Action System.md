This game is played turn-based, with turn order determined at the start of the battle with an Initiative roll. The actions you can take on your turn are as follows.

- [[Standard Action]]: This action occupies most of your turn, and you can perform one per turn.
    
    - **Example**: The Attack Action is the most common, allowing a series of smaller attacks up to your Attack Speed, executed in any order. Refer to the "Attack" section for more details.
        
    

- [[Swift Action]]: This action can be executed during any other action, with a limit of one per turn.
    

- [[Free Action]]: These actions are effortless or part of other actions, allowing you to perform as many as you wish per turn - within reason.
    

- [[Full-Round Action]]: This action requires the use of your standard action and all of your free [[Movement]]. You may still move if you have an ability that allows extra movement as a different action.
    

When it's not your turn, you can take the following actions:

- [[Immediate Action]]: A Swift Action that can occur off-turn. Limited to one per round, shared with Swift Action — you cannot use both in the same round.
    

- [[Instant Action]]: A Free Action that can occur off-turn. Referred to as "Instantly" in abilities.
    
    - [[AoO|Attack of Opportunity]]: A response triggered by certain actions of others. Limited to one per round. When a creature "Provokes," they are engaging in an action that allows others to AoO them.

- [[Movement]]: You can move up to your Speed on your turn. Some abilities or effects may require spending a certain amount of your movement for the turn. You may have other forms of movement that manifest in terms of different Speeds - you may use multiple forms of movement on the same turn, but only up to the maximum amount for the given speed. Any slower speeds used overlap - That is, if you have a [[Fly]] 40 and a ground speed of 30, you may walk 30 feet and then fly another 10.
