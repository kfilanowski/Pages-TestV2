Hover [[Speed|Speeds]] allow [[Movement]] above solid and liquid surfaces while ignoring [[Difficult Terrain]]. They may remain in the air as long as they have a Fly Speed - Flying targets get +4 [[AC]] against [[Ranged Attack|Ranged Attacks]] while flying.
A creature that is [[Entangled]] or [[Grounded]] cannot continue flight.
A creature that takes damage from an [[Attack]] or [[AoE]] effect while flying receives [[Clumsy]] 1 until they land, up to 6 stacks.
