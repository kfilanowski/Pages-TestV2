Default ground movement speed is 30. 
Race, Class, Equipment, and Status can change this.
Some actions grant extra speed.

You may have other forms of movement that manifest in terms of different Speeds - you may use multiple forms of movement on the same turn, but only up to the maximum amount for the given speed. Any slower speeds used overlap - That is, if you have a [[Fly]] 40 and a ground speed of 30, you may walk 30 feet and then fly another 10.
