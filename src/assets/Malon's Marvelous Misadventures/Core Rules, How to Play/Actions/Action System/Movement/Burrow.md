Burrow [[Speed|Speeds]] allow [[Movement]] through dirt, clay, and other particulate turf, but not solid rocks (unless otherwise stated). Burrowing leaves a temporary hole the size of the creature that burrowed for a few rounds, depending on the sediment type, unless the creature takes measures to avoid this. 

Starting to burrow is a [[Swift Action]] that [[AoO|Provokes]] as if leaving a [[Threaten|Threatened]] space.
