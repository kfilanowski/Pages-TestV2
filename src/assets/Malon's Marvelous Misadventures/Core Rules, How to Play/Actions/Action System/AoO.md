 **Attack of Opportunity (AoO)**: An [[Instant Action]] [[Attack]] triggered in response to certain actions of others. All creatures can do this once per round by default. When a creature "Provokes," they are engaging in an action that allows others to AoO them.

Movement can only provoke once from a given creature per turn.
