You can prepare swift actions, movement, free actions and standard actions to react to a specific triggering event (Ex: “a goblin opens this door, I walk up to him and shove him off the cliff”). If the triggering action never happens, you don't get your actions back.

When you prepare a standard action to attack, you can only prepare a single attack.

You cannot prepare actions outside of Initiative.
