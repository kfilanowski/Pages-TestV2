Jump in a straight line. This can only be used in combination with other forms of movement such as walking or charging.

Jump is also a statistic. By default, your Jump is 5. This is a measure of distance, specifically for horizontal jumps, while vertical jumps are half. This does not give you additional [[movement]], and the thus it is limited by your [[Speed]], unless your Jump is higher than your Speed (in which case it functions as your total movement limit when jumping). It can be used to avoid [[Difficult Terrain]], but not if you're already in the Difficult Terrain.

You can only jump once with this action. If you [[Dash]], you can jump twice. These jumps do not need to be consecutive.

Jump distance increases by 5 ft per point of [[DEX]] (and [[STR]] with [[Athletics]]).
