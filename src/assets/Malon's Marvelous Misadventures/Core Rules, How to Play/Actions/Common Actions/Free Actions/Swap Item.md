At the start of your turn, you can decide what's in your hands from your inventory. You can draw and put away any weapons without penalty. This is a [[Free Action]] as long as it's done at the start of your turn. If you decide to change what you're wielding at another point in your turn, it becomes a [[Swift Action]] - and you can't do both.
