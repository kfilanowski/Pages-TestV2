**Hitpoints (HP)** are a representation of how much offense you can weather. If you run out of HP, you are [[Defeated]]. Your total HP is determined primarily by [[Class]], but can also be augmented by abilities, [[Feat]]s, and even [[Race]].

When you take [[Damage]], you reduce your *current HP* out of your normal maximum HP. Your current HP value can be negative.

Every character with a class starts with 30 HP, with an additional bonus from their class every level (Usually around +10).
