When a creature falls to 0 [[HP]], they gain the [[Defeated]] condition. They cannot do anything more than a mild whisper while at or below 0 HP. If they are healed to positive hit points, they do not lose the Defeated condition, but they may [[Crawl]] at a rate of 10 feet per turn, or move at full speed when assisted by another creature.

This mostly only applies to important characters. A character is important when the players or DM say so (often the player characters themselves, an NPC relevant to the story, or a major villain). When an important character defeats an unimportant character, it is assumed they are killed outright unless otherwise stated by the characters attacking.

If a creature reaches an amount of negative HP equal to its maximum HP, it dies outright regardless of its importance.
