The purpose of resurrection in TTRPGs is primarily for the benefit of the players. If a DM makes frequent use of the resurrection spells for entities that the players went to great lengths to kill, it heavily undermines their effort and feels terrible, even if plausible.

The powers that be should instead be very particular about the who gets a second chance. If the players are the main character of the story, then the game's resurrection mechanics should treat them as such. As a replacement for most resurrection effects, use these rules instead. Or don't use resurrection at all. It's your game. Whatever.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Please make sure your players are on board with whatever you decide. Nobody likes surprise mechanics.
