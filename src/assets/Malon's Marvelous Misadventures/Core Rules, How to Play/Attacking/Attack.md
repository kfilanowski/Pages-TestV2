**Attack** rolls are any type of harmful effect targeting a creature that does not require a saving throw. This can be spells, swords, or trying to push your foe off of a cliff (see Combat Maneuvers).

**Default:** [[Roll]]+[[ACC|ACC]]+/-(circumstantial bonuses or penalties)

When you roll an attack, you compare it to the target's AC. If you roll under it, you miss, and you usually deal no damage. If you meet it, you hit, and roll the damage associated with the attack. If you roll 20 or more points over their Avoid, you [[Crit|Critically Strike]] (Crit), adding your [[Critical Damage]] to the attack.
