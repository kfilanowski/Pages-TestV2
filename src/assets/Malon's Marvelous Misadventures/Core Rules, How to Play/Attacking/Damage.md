**Damage** is a value that subtracts from a target's [[HP]] when the effect takes place.
"Losing HP" is synonymous with taking Damage.

Damage is always assigned a type. The physical damage types are [[Crush]], [[Slash]], and [[Pierce]], and the elemental types are [[Magic]], [[Lightning]], [[Fire]], [[Cold]], [[Holy]], [[Necrotic]], and [[Psychic]]. These are also Tags.

If something deals multiple damage types, it usually adds both tags to the effect. For example, a flaming sword will deal Fire and Slash damage with its total damage, rather than separate d6 slash and d4 fire. Fire and Cold effects are mutually exclusive.

For [[Weapon|Weapons]], damage is determined by the weapon used and adds your [[STR|STR]]. A [[Technique]] may add to this as well.
For [[Spell]], this value is determined by your [[Lv|LV]] and [[SP]].
Any given effect will describe how to determine the damage it deals.
