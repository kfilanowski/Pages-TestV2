A Targeted ability refers to one where you must select targets to apply the effect, which is not an [[Attack]] [[Roll]]. Some abilities are particular about what they work on, and will fail if used outside of their scope. You must have [[Line of Effect]] and be able to see your target to target them. If you cannot see them, you must target their space with the intention of targeting them.
