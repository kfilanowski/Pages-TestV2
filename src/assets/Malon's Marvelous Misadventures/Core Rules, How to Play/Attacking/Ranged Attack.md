A Ranged Attack is an [[Attack]] made with ranged targeting. This means you can make the attack up to the listed range, not limited by the space you [[Threaten]]. These attacks can also be penalized due to [[Cover]]. Physical Ranged Attacks have two listed ranges - the first is [[Close Range]] and the second is [[Wide Range]].

Abilities that function from a distance but do not use an Attack [[Roll]] are not Ranged Attacks.
