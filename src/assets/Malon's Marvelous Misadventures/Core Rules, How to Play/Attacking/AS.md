**Attack Speed (AS)**: In order to decide how many attacks to make, you must use the AS of anything available to you when you take your [[Attack Action]]. Most weapons have an AS greater than 1, allowing you to make multiple attacks. If you have multiple ways to attack, you can combine them together. However, you cannot "overlap" your AS. To visualize this -

Here we have a character that has a dagger in hand with an AS of 5, a mace in the other with an AS of 3, and multiple [[Action-Attack]]s with an AS of 1. ~={red}He can take one action from every column, =~meaning if you use a [[Spell]] (AS-1) you can no longer do any attacks that use the same column. He could do
- 5 dagger attacks
- 4 dagger attacks and a Spell
- a Special Attack and 2 mace attacks and 2 dagger attacks, etc...

However, he cannot do a Spell and a Special Attack on the same turn, as they only have an AS of 1 individually.
