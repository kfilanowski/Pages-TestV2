When using something in each hand, you gain the full benefits of both. You may benefit from two staves granting casting bonuses, use both of their [[AS|AS]], a sword and shield - whatever you like. If you use two weapons of the same AS, they gain +1 AS. Both weapons must be used at least once. You cannot engage in Dual-Wielding if you have a Two-Handed item. For example, you cannot swing a greatsword and then use [[Unarmed Strike]]s or throw shuriken with their higher AS.
