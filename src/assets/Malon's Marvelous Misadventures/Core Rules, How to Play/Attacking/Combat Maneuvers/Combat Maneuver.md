**Combat Maneuvers** are [[Action-Attack]] that target [[AC|AC]]. AC should have separate notes for bonuses towards specific maneuvers. You add both [[STR]] and [[DEX]] to these attacks, rather than just DEX. When making a Combat Maneuver, you must decide which specific form it takes, such as a Fell, Dirty Trick, or Shove. A successful Combat Maneuver will inflict a condition based on the form you chose. 
Combat Maneuvers can sometimes benefit from rolling a Critical Hit, by augmenting its power instead of its damage.
