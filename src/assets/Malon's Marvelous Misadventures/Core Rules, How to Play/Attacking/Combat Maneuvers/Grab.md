Requires a free hand or prehensile appendage. As long as the Grab persists, you and your foe gain the [[Entangled]] condition, the grabber is considered Grabbing, and the target is considered Grabbed. Each round you can spend another [[Action-Attack]] to maintain the Grab and deal damage as per a melee [[Attack]], requiring no [[Roll]].

If you are moved out of reach from the target, your opponent succeeds at a Grab on you, or you are otherwise unable to maintain your grip, the target is freed and the conditions end. Opponents that Grab you in return can continue the Grab as if they are Grabbing.

Special: Multiple creatures can Grab one creature. The Entangled conditions stack.

Special: Creatures ignore the attack penalty from partial and total concealment against creatures they are engaged in a Grab with.

See alternate win condition>restraint/capture for more options on locking someone down for good.
