This game relies on a special roll, detailed below. It will be referred to as dX in the content.

Action resolution is done by using random chance to represent a range of success in an attempt to reach a target number, combined with a bonus based on your character's build, such as from their ability scores, skills, class features, active buffs, and feats.

Content is currently being made with a roll equivalent to counting successes on a d15 die, exploding on any number above 1, success being any roll (including the first). This can be written into rolling simulator websites such as Roll20 to speed things up.

The benefit of this method is that anyone can roll any number, unlike other systems where a large enough target number will make the roll impossible.

~={blue}The Short Version:=~ Every point added for or against these rolls is about a 7% difference in power. This means [[Attack]] [[Roll]]s, [[Skill]] checks, [[Saving Throw]]s, [[DC]]s, [[AC|Avoid]], all of it. ~={blue}A 6 point difference is roughly a 50% boost in odds. A 10 point difference is about double.=~ As an example, if you gain 10 Accuracy or 10 Stealth, your odds of success are about twice as high. This is the case regardless of the opponent's statistics.
