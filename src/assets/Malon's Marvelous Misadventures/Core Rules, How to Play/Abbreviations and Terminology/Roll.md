The default die roll for resolving things. This is used to determine the variance expected.

In Malon's Marvelous Misadventures, this is a 15-sided die, rolled until a result of a [[Natural]] 1 shows up. The amount of rolls (including the one that results in the natural 1) is totaled as the result. For example, if it took 12 rolls, then the result of this "roll" is 12.
