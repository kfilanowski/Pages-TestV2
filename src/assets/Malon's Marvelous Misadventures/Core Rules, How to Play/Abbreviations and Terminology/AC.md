Avoidability Capacity (AC) is the measure of how difficult it is to hit you. Targets must meet or exceed your AC with an [[Attack]] to [[Damage]] you or succeed at a [[Combat Maneuver]].

By default, your starting AC is 10, and you add your [[LV]], [[DEX]], [[LUK]], and [[Armor]], and adjust it based on [[Circumstance]].
