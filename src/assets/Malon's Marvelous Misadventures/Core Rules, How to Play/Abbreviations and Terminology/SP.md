## Spell Power
Many [[Spell]] and similar abilities have their variable effects based on Spell Power. 
Spell Power is decided by your [[Staff]] of choice (usually d6) plus your [[INT]].

Spells often include Spell Power in their total damage. When they do, they may also add Spell Power when Upcast.
