Damage Reduction (DR) is a rare form of defense that reduces incoming damage by a flat amount, noted as a value (DR x). If not specified, DR applies to physical damage, and DRA applies to all [[Damage]] types. All DR stacks.

Stacking defenses works in the way that protects the most - such as applying DR after [[Resistance]]. If an effect's damage is reduced to 0 with DR, then any associated non-damaging effects are negated.
