Circumstance is any in-game situation, event, or position that conditionally applies a bonus, penalty, or [[Status]] to a creature. 
Circumstances can apply to different creatures in different ways, usually based on positioning or the presence or absence of abilities - for example, having a low wall to grant you [[Cover]] will work for any creatures on the other side of the wall, but not on the same side as you. One creature may see you while you're in a cloud, while another cannot. You may be above one creature, but another creature may be above you. Therefore, these effects are circumstantial.
