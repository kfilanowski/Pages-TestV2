As a Turn-Based Game, Initiative decides who goes first.

Initiative is d10+[[Reflex]]. Some bonuses apply specifically to Initiative.

Whoever rolls higher goes first. Ties are broken first by the higher bonus, then [[PC]]s take priority.

In the event where there are two parties that don't immediately fight, initiative starts when someone takes an aggressive action, such as casting a spell or drawing an arrow. In these cases, where both parties are aware of each other, initiative gets rolled immediately before any actions happen, but the individual that took the aggressive action gains a +10 bonus to their Initiative. This means being the first to say "I attack!" usually means going first.

Certain types of underhanded tactics can affect who goes first, such as using [[Hands]] to draw a concealed weapon or [[Deception]] for a sucker punch.

Anyone that is not aware of combat is placed below anyone that was aware when initiative was rolled, regardless of their initiative result. This usually happens as a result of [[Stealth]] or an attack against sleeping opponents.
