**Improved** [[Cover]] is an environmental [[Circumstance]] that increases your [[AC]] and [[Reflex]] by 8.
Improved Cover is received against [[Ranged Attack]]s and [[AoE]]s that target you while there are obstacles between you and the source of the attack that obscure almost all of your space, usually intentionally designed to allow attacks only in one direction, and that cannot be pierced by the attack.

Examples include arrow slits and murder holes., as well as ranged weapon attacks against [[Submerged]] targets.
