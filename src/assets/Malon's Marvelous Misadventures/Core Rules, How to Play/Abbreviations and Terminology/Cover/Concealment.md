**Concealment** is a [[Circumstance]] that is gained when a creature's position is being obscured from another's [[Senses]]. 

Usually, this means an effect like fog or darkness is partially or totally hiding a creature from another, resulting in [[Partial Concealment]] or [[Total Concealment]], but this may take other forms against creatures that have other senses.

Concealment is a condition that's relative to the senses of other creatures. If you have [[Dark Vision]] and your opponent doesn't in a situation with [[Darkness]], you have concealment against them, but they don't have concealment to you.

Attacking from concealment, even Total Concealment, does not [[Surprised|Surprise]] by default. You still need to use [[Stealth]] as normal.
