**Cover** is an environmental [[Circumstance]] that increases your [[AC]] and [[Reflex]] by 4.
Standard Cover is received against [[Ranged Attack]]s and [[AoE]]s that target you while there are obstacles between you and the source of the attack that obscure a large portion of your space, and that cannot be pierced by the attack. 

Better forms of cover result in [[Improved Cover]] and [[Total Cover]].

Examples include peeking around a pillar, over a trench, or behind a low wall.
