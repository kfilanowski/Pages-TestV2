**Player Character (PC)**: A character controlled by a player, and not the [[DM]]. Players are the main characters of a story, and thus gain port priority in some aspects.

Sometimes, a DM will play a special character alongside the players that is treated like a PC. This is normal, but the players can veto such a character's PC status if they feel it is inappropriate.
