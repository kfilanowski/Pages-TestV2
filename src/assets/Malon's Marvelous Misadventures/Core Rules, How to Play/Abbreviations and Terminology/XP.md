Experience is a meta-currency gained through prioritizing primary campaign events that allows players to influence the story/chronological order of things in order to accomplish personal goals quickly and get back into the action faster. As a baseline, 10 XP is the equivalent of one in-game day of events. 
Experience is rewarded for spending time working towards campaign goals in an active manner. This mainly means exploring dungeons, splitting heads, and overthrowing governments - anything that is both related to the main campaign objectives, and is not part of downtime events (such as recovering from an [[Affliction]] or [[Crafting]]). XP is rewarded based on the time required to complete the mission, with additional bonuses for overcoming particular challenges.
The purpose of XP is to reward taking action. While downtime is an important part of roleplay, it's easy to justify staying in town making safe money or doing side quests to save up for a shiny new weapon or achieve personal goals if there isn't an obvious time constraint on important story events. It's easy to hold off on an important event and try to squeeze a few more days of crafting into your schedule.
Instead, XP serves to reward taking action immediately, without penalizing downtime events like crafting.
