This game is meant to be played on a grid of hexes or squares. Personally, I prefer hexes. Creatures must be represented in such a space. That's why creatures are broken up into size categories.

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Size|Space|Reach|Description|
|Tiny|1 space|0 ft|Typical for fairies and pets like cats. Tiny creatures are usually around 1 ft tall and weight <10 lbs.|
|Small|1 space|5 ft|Typical for goblins and common animals like dogs. Small creatures are usually around 3ft tall and weigh around 30 lbs.|
|Medium|1 space|5 ft|Most common size for creatures in general. Medium creatures are usually around 6 ft tall and weigh around 150 lbs.|
|Large|~3 spaces|10 ft|Common size for monsters like giants. Large creatures are usually around 10 ft tall and weight around 600 lbs.|
|Huge|~7 spaces|15 ft|Enormous monsters like dragons fit here. Huge creatures are usually around 15 ft tall and weigh around 3k lbs.|
|Massive|10+ spaces|20 ft+|Massive creatures are terrifying monstrosities like kaiju and dinosaurs. Massive creatures are over 20 ft tall and weigh tons.|

Creatures threaten all spaces they occupy by default.

You can enter the space of a creature that is a size category larger or smaller than you. If you leave a space occupied by a creature, it provokes an AoO as though you were leaving a threatened area. If you get attacked this way, the same creature can't also AoO you for leaving their threatened square in the same turn.
