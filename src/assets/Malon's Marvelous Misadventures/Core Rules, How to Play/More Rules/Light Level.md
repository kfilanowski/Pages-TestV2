Light comes in 3 forms.

==Bright Light== A sunny day or a torch lit room. Bright light let's creatures see things clearly. Most creatures can see in bright light without any penalty.

==Dim Light== Moonlight or at the edge of your torch light. Many humanoids cannot see well in dim light. Features in dim light appear only as a silhouette with dull, if any, color. Without special senses, creatures have [[Partial Concealment]] in dim light.

==Darkness== The depths of a cave or deep underwater. Few creatures can see clearly in a complete darkness. Some, such as humans, can't see at all. Those that can (such as with night vision or Darkvision) still only see in grayscale. Without special senses, creatures have [[Total Concealment]] in darkness.
