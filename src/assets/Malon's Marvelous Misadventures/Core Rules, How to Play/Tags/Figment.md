Figments create creatures, objects, and terrain that don’t truly exist. As long as the creature does not directly interact with a figment, it believes it to be real. If a creature figures out that it's fake and tells its allies, or demonstrates by moving through it, they no longer believe it to be real. Directly interacting requires doing things like walking into a wall or attacking a creature, upon which the creature rolls a [[Will]] save. A failure indicates the creature will try to run around an obstacle or that they missed a creature.

If used to satisfy the conditions of a surrender (such as making a spooky monster), the creatures affected get a will save to negate it. They have +6 on this save if they saw you cast the spell.
