An effect with the **Concentration** tag requires some degree of upkeep from the caster and typically has a duration. Concentration effects end if the caster is [[Defeated]], [[Stunned]], put [[Asleep]], or otherwise completely prevented from taking any actions. You can also cease concentration [[Instant Action|Instantly]]. 
If you cast a spell with concentration, you must hold the staff in order to maintain your concentration. Being disarmed of a staff you are using to concentrate ends the effect. While you are concentrating on a spell, you cannot use that staff to cast other spells. However, you can use another staff to cast spells, or concentrate on another.
