**Polymorph** effects transform creatures into other creatures. Many of the features granted from polymorph effects are based off the Shapeshifter's class features. You retain the ability to speak while polymorphed. When transforming using a polymorph effect, it can fall under one of the following to determine the nature of your transformation (some can be multiple).

**Chimeric Polymorph** - Your form stays roughly the same, but acquires some features of the new creature that you're transforming into, such as claws, fur, a long tongue etc. When you chimeric polymorph, you do not lose access to any of your gear.

**True Polymorph** - Your form completely changes to the form mentioned in the ability. You completely lose access to all of your equipment. There are only a handful of features recognizable from your previous self, such as eye color.

**Baleful Polymorph** - This form of polymorph is inflicted upon you rather than willingly used. It functions very similarly to true polymorph, but provides fewer tangible benefits and often include debilitating [[Status]]. You lose access to your equipment and cannot speak.
