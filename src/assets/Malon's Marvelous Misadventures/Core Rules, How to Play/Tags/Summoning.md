The Summoning [[Tag]] is placed on abilities that conjure a creature.

Many summoned creatures are specific individuals that you must form a [[Summoning Contract]] with. However, Summoning [[Technique|Techniques]] do not usually call for a specific individual, instead conjuring a temporary disposable [[Minion]] with no prior setup.

Summoned creatures instantly disappear when [[Defeated]].
