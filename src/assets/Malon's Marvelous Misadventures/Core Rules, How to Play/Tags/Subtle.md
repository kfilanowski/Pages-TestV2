The effect has a chance for nobody to notice it. If the target creature fails its save, then the effect goes unnoticed. The [[DC]] to [[Identify Spell]] with the subtle tag increases by 5.

If someone is watching you and suspects you are using a subtle spell in their presence, they can use [[Detect]] to get a [[Perception]] check at -10 against the Identify Spell DC of the effect.
