In media it's very common for creatures to have minions, squires and sidekicks. This is what the companion system is for. Like most other content, the companion system is ill-suited for large quantities of creatures, like armies. It's meant to be more compact. Something to take with you on the go for your adventure. This could also reasonably extend to temporary allies that join your party.

Companions are generally tied to your class, abilities and items. Any such ability is marked with this tag.

If an ability has the companion tag, it summons an ally, or otherwise serves some kind of interpersonal function. 

>You can have 1+[[CHA]] Companions.
>Companions always act on your turn if you are present. There is no separation between your turns, you all act in the same [[Initiative]] (rolled by you). 
>Companions gain bonuses or penalties based off of your CHA.
