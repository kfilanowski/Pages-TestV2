Creature is knocked [[Prone]] until the start of the inflicting creature or effect's next turn, at which point the condition ends without [[AoO|Provoking]] or spending [[Movement]], unless the creature is [[Held Down]].
Swimming creatures can be prone, but airborne creatures become Grounded instead.
