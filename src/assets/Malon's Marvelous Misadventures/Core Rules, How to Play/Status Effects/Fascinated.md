  - Fascination

Creature cannot take actions other than watch the source of its fascination. Creature loses this condition after it is attacked, has a [[Saving Throw]] inflicted on it, or succeeds on a [[Perception]] check to notice a creature in its pockets or otherwise taking an offensive action. If the source of its fascination is no longer visible (or able to be sensed for other types of fascination), the condition also ends. After this happens, the creature temporarily becomes immune to fascination for 1 minute.
