Creature is unable to respond effectively to attacks due to [[Stealth]], [[Feint|Feinting]], or some other status or [[Circumstance]]. Attacks made against a Surprised creature get a +10 bonus.

This status effect is also a Circumstance that can be determined on a per-creature or per-attack basis, but can also be a condition that applies to all incoming attacks.

Creatures Surprised by the start of a combat also place below non-Surprised creatures regardless of [[Initiative]] result.
