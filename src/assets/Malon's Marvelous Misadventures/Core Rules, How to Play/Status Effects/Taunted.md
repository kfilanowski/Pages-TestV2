A Taunted creature must use all their attacks on the target of the taunt, and must include the target in all of their special attacks ([[Spell]]s, [[Supernatural]], etc.). A taunted creature can only move if the movement puts them closer to the creature that taunted it.

A creature taunted by 2 or more creatures may decide which they'd like to attack (assuming they attack at all).

More extreme forms of taunt may restrict the types of actions the creature can take while taunted.
