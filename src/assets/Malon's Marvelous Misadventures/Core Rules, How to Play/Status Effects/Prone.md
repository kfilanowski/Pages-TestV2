Creature is lying down or otherwise on the ground, has -4 [[AC]] and [[ACC]], and can't move unless they spend 30 movement to end the condition, which [[AoO|Provokes]].

Prone creatures gain +4 AC against [[Ranged Attack|Ranged Attacks]] instead.

This condition ends automatically after one round unless otherwise stated.
