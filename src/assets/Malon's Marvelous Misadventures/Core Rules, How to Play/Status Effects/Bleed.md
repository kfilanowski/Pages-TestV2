Bleeding creatures lose the specified amount of [[HP]] at the start of each of their turns for a specified duration. If no duration is specified, it lasts indefinitely. The [[DC]] to stop the bleeding (with the [[Medicine]] skill, or magic healing with a [[CL]] check) is the attacker's [[Potency]].

Unlike most sources of Damage, Bleed effects do not deal a specific type of damage. They act as their own type in the sense that creatures can resist or be immune to it, but Bleed is a condition and not a real Damage type.
