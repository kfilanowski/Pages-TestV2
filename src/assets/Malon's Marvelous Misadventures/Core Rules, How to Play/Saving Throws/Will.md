**Will** [[Saving Throw|Saves]] are one of the three primary Saves [[Roll]]ed to avoid a negative effect.
Your Will represents your mental resilience and ability to resist mental attacks such as [[Illusion]]s, mind control, and [[Fear]].
You add [[WIS]] and [[LV]] to your Will, as well as any bonuses from your [[Class]].
