**Reflex** [[Saving Throw|Saves]] are one of the three primary Saves [[Roll]]ed to avoid a negative effect.
Your Reflex represents your reactions and ability to evade or mitigate sudden attacks such as [[Area Effect]]s and [[Trap]]s.
You add [[DEX]] and [[LV]] to your Reflex, as well as any bonuses from your [[Class]].
