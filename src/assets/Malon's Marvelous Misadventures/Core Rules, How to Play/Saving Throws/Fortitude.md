**Fortitude** [[Saving Throw|Saves]] are one of the three primary Saves [[Roll]]ed to avoid a negative effect.
Your Fortitude represents your resistance to physical hardship, such as [[Poison]], [[Disease]], and concussive attacks.
You add [[STR]] and [[LV]] to your Fortitude, as well as any bonuses from your [[Class]].
