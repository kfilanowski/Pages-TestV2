**Saving Throws (Saves)** are [[Roll]]s decide the effectiveness of abilities or effects that do not require an [[Attack]]. It is typically the affected creature that rolls the save. In order to consider a saving throw a pass, the affected creature must roll higher than the [[DC]] of the effect.

The DC of a Saving Throw is usually 10 plus the [[Lv|Level]] of the effect, or the attacking creature's Potency.

Saves come in 3 forms: [[Fortitude]] saves (based on [[STR]]), [[Reflex]] saves (based on [[DEX]]), and [[Will]] saves (based on [[WIS]]).
