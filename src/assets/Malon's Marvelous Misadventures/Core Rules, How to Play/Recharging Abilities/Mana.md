**Mana Slots (Mana)**: All creatures have 2+[[LV]] Mana unless otherwise stated.

When selecting [[Techniques]] or [[Spell]], each one takes up one Mana Slot, unless otherwise stated.

How you use a given slot is determined by whether the ability is [[At-Will]], [[Recharge]], or [[Limited]].

- At-Will abilities can be used as you like, without affecting the Mana Slot.

- Recharge abilities will temporarily consume the slot until you use the [[Recharge Abilities]] action. You do not need to re-prepare the ability, it returns to the slot as if it was not spent once you use the recharge action.

- Limited abilities will make you lose the slot until you Long Rest. This is sometimes referred to as [[Mana Burn]]. You can re-prepare the ability to assign it to a different slot and continue to use it.

When you learn abilities that must be assigned to a slot, you must [[Rest]] to assign them to those slots. A given ability can only be assigned once in your loadout. You can rest again to reassign your abilities.

Abilities gained through class features or items usually do not take up Mana Slots, and thus you cannot re-prepare your ability to a different slot if it's Limited.
