Most creatures that can speak will know Common. Some isolated or xenophobic creatures may only speak their native tongue.


| Common Languages |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Common           | The default tongue - most intelligent creatures can speak this language with some level of proficiency. Conveniently, it's the same language the players speak at the table.                                                       |
| Fiendish         | The language of Fiends. As a language created by creatures that seek only destruction, the language includes guttural sounds and subtle hums as a means of intimidation, and to better convey double meanings and secret messages. |
| Celestial        | The language of Celestials. Originally used for holy invocations, oaths, and singing - making its native speakers easy to spot from how melodic their speech is.                                                                   |
| Sylvan           | The language of Fey. When nature speaks, this is the language it uses.                                                                                                                                                             |
