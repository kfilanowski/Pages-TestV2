Using [[Linguistics]], you can write things in ways that are difficult to interpret without a cipher, such as disguising your forbidden ritual as a cookbook. The [[DC]] to your code is 10+(Linguistics bonus). Creatures that know the code can read encoded text, but creatures that don't will interpret the text as something else. To read encoded text, you must first crack the code, usually requiring at least a week of research. At the end of the week, roll a Linguistics check versus the writer’s DC to crack the code.
