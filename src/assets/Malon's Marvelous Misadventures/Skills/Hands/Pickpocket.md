As a [[Standard Action]], use [[Proficiency|Trained]] [[Hands]] on a distracted or [[Surprised]] creature to pilfer an object off of their person. This is opposed to the [[Perception]] of the target and any nearby creatures that can witness you. Failure indicates that the target noticed an unwanted intrusion on their person, and the theft fails.
Items that are closely bound to the target cause a -5 penalty to Pickpocket. 

Items that are worn or held in the hands cannot be pickpocketed.
