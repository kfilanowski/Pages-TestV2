Use [[Hands]] to conceal an item on your person. Should someone search you or otherwise have access to you to find such an item (such as if your clothes was lifted), you must roll Hands against their [[Perception]] to prevent them from discovering the item. Concealed items cannot be procured as a [[Free Action]] or [[Instant Action]].

You can use [[Proficiency|Trained]] Hands as a [[Swift Action]] to draw a concealed weapon. If you win the opposed check, the target is [[Surprised]] against your next attack. You can use this as an alternative to [[Stealth]] to Surprise an enemy when you are otherwise in a neutral position, and the opposing party is aware of you.
