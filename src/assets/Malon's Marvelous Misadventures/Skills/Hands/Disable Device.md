Use [[Hands]] to disable a trap or similar mechanism, magical or mundane, as long as it is armed and you have detected its presence. Failure triggers the trap.

If you are [[Proficiency|Proficient]] in Hands, you can disable it temporarily or otherwise slightly modify the trap to better suit your needs.
