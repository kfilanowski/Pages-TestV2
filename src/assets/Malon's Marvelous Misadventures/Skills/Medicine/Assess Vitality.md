Using [[Medicine]], you can examine a creature that is wounded to determine how they were injured, how long ago it happened, and whether they are in grave danger of dying. This also functions on corpses for cause of death. The more complex the ailment and the longer the duration since it happened, the higher the [[DC]]. Difficulty based on duration may reverse in scaling in the case of diseases, where more time passing makes the symptoms more obvious.
