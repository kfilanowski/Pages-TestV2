Use [[Invocation]] to try and trigger the effects of a magical device without meeting the requirements for its use, such as bypassing a password, activating an item you're not qualified to use, or activating a [[sigil]] that only works in the presence of another type of creature. 

You have no control over the effect once it's active. Failing this check often comes with unforeseen consequences.
