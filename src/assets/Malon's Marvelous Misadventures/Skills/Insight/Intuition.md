By using [[Proficiency|Trained]] [[Insight]], you can observe a structure or item whose function is known, an event unfolding, or a behavior pattern to try and glean information about it. The [[DC]] is modified by how much knowledge you already possess on the topic, or how closely you're able to investigate it. A success gives you nearly prescient knowledge about the intention behind the structure, item, event, or behavioral pattern that goes beyond a basic understanding of function.

For example, when used on a [[Trap]] whose function is to shoot an arrow, your character may determine that based on its unusual angle and obvious placement, it may have been used to deter adventures from finding a secret in its line of sight instead of to actually effectively trap them. The knowledge you glean from this success will always be the reality of the situation when you follow your intuition.
