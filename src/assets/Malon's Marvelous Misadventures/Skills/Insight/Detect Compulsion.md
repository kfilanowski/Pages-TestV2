Use [[Proficiency|Trained]] [[Insight]] to determine when a creature is under duress from a spell or some other kind of effect that has a lasting impact on their mind, such as when [[Dominated]] or [[Possessed]]. You must actively search for this by speaking with the creature for 1 minute. [[Roll]] Insight vs the [[DC]] of the effect. If the effect has no DC, assume a basic DC based on the [[Potency]] of the source.
