As a [[Standard Action]], you become more observant of your surroundings, gaining an additional [[Perception]] check to detect traps, creatures, or details that are hidden from view. 

When a creature is not doing anything with its Standard Action and is moving at a normal pace, it is assumed to be using Detect Hidden Presence every round.
