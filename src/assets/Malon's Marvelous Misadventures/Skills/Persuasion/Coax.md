When an [[NPC]] is on the fence or indifferent about a request, and the requester doesn't have anything left to say to sway them, [[Persuasion]] can be used to get the target to agree or counter-offer.
The [[DC]] varies based on how effective the conversation was before rolling. Requests that align with the target's interests, offerings that make them happy, and moral arguments that resonate with their values will lower the DC, while the opposite will increase it.
Passing the check results in the NPC requesting something in return, while rolling significantly higher may cause them to waive any additional requests, or even offer additional assistance that wasn't requested.
This action can also be used when the NPC already agreed due to good conversation in-character, in order to try to sweeten the deal if the requester rolls exceptionally well.
