As a [[Swift Action]], Use [[Stealth]] to prevent enemies from knowing your exact location. This lasts until you are spotted.
Whenever an enemy has line of sight to you, or you cause some other detectable stimuli, they roll [[Perception]] against your Stealth. If you [[Attack]] a creature, it gets a +20 bonus on its check. A [[Ranged Attack]] grants a +10 bonus.

While moving at half speed or slower and not having taken an action, you get an additional [[Roll]] to avoid detection.

You can only take this action while you have [[Cover]] or [[Concealment]].
