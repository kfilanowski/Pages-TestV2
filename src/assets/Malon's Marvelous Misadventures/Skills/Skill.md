Skill [[Roll]]s are how players interact with the world without hitting it with their sword. Even if certain actions have a skill associated with them, you don't necessarily need to roll a skill check (no need to roll [[Deception]] if they already believe you, no need to roll [[Athletics]] in still water, etc.) When one is required, it is prompted by the [[DM]].

If the [[DC]] to a task is more than 30 points higher than the bonus on the roll, then the DM should deem it impossible in cases where "fishing" for a success with no repercussions is the intent. The special roll allows rolling any number, so if a task is well out of a character's reach such that the DC difference is that high, it may be better to not allow the roll to preserve the narrative.

This roll can be very swingy, creating dramatically unexpected results. As such, using a skill roll as a barrier for entry can create all or nothing scenarios. There's nothing wrong with saying "the lock is too complex for you to pick," but you can't be upset when immediately after the martials of the party start smashing into the door. There should be lesser versions of success. If you barely fail the DC to scale a wall, it lowers your speed instead of falling. If you barely fail a [[Stealth]] check while trailing someone, they can tell someone is in the bushes, but not who.

Many things should not be represented by a skill or ability roll. For example, do not roll to see if someone can lift a portcullis - This is already represented by their Carrying Capacity. You should also carefully consider what a roll represents, and whether rerolls are appropriate. When rolls are made, don't be surprised when the party's expert sometimes gets outdone by the party's pet chicken. A skill check should be summarized with a "you can or you can't" when rolling may cause inconsistencies.

Skill bonuses are increased by one relevant [[Ability Scores|Ability Score]] modifier. You add 2x the bonus to your skill check if you are [[Proficient]].

[[Proficiency]] in a skill grants you a 2+[[LV]] bonus to the skill. Certain aspects of a skill might only be available to characters that are proficient in the skill.

Standard skill [[DC]]s are what should be used in the absence of a set or opposed DC. Remember that every 10 point difference makes the task twice as hard. They are as follows…


| Difficulty        | DC  |
| ----------------- | --- |
| Mundane           | 0   |
| Requires Focus    | 10  |
| Trained           | 20  |
| Difficult         | 30  |
| Masterwork        | 40  |
| Nearly Impossible | 50  |
| Ascended          | 60  |
