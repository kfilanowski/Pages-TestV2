Using [[Proficiency|Trained]] [[Deception]], spend 10 minutes perfecting your makeup, outfit, and wig to appear as a person or playable race you're not. Disguise checks are usually unnecessary unless you fall under scrutiny, the person knows you/what you're pretending to be, or you're trying to enter an exclusive club, in which case they get a [[Perception]] check. Creatures get bonuses to their Perception if they know you or what you're disguised as particularly well.

You take a -2 penalty to Disguise when you try to change your race and when you change your apparent gender. When you initiate a Disguise, you tell your DM your bonus, they apply any appropriate Circumstance modifiers and roll it in secret.

Crafting a disguise without a disguise kit or magic imposes a -5 penalty.
