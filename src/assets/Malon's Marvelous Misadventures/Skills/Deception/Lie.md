Use [[Deception]] against a target's [[Insight]] to speak falsehoods, or to soften the truth. See [[Detect Dishonesty]]. It may be more entertaining if the [[DM]] rolls this in secret to preserve tension.

Common modifiers to increase the [[DC]] include:

- The target has firsthand experience with the events
- Claims that are fantastical or impossible, such as equating angels with demons or asserting a green sky
- The target is knowledgeable of the subject matter

Common modifiers to make the task less difficult can include:

- The target is inattentive, such as from being tired or drunk
- The target trusts you
