By speaking in roundabout terms and making subtle gestures, you can use [[Proficiency|Trained]] [[Deception]] to communicate a simple idea (such as "we need to leave", or "time to strike") while not talking about it directly, to avoid alerting others of your intentions. The [[DC]] to convey this message is 20. The intended recipient automatically understands the message. Anyone that may be suspicious gets an [[Insight]] check to beat your [[Deception]].
