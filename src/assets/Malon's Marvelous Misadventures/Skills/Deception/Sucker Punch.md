If you are in some kind of standoff where you aren't quite fighting your enemy yet, you can use [[Proficiency|Trained]] [[Deception]] or Trained [[Hands]] as a replacement for [[Stealth]] to [[Surprised|Surprise]] your enemy with a melee [[Attack]]. The enemy must be aware of you in order to Sucker Punch, otherwise it is [[Stealth]], and you must already be adjacent to use Hands for it. If you don't use an [[Unarmed Strike]], then you have disadvantage on this check, unless you use Hands.

Certain situations where you are not able to get close to your aggressors, such as having bows pointed at you from a garrison above you, make Sucker Punching impossible.
