If [[Proficiency|Trained]] in [[Acrobatics]], As long as there are 2 walls within 5 feet of each other, or a similar arrangement with some horizontal layout, you can continually hop between them to ascend or travel. Only the vertical OR horizontal distance you cover counts against your [[Movement]], not both. This still takes a [[Jump]] action.
