Using [[Astronomy]] with aid of devices such as telescopes (if necessary), you can determine the cause of cosmic phenomenon, or you can predict them in advance. This can be something like a solar eclipse, a comet, or something more drastic like a meteor or supernova.

You can also tell if something unusual is happening, such as someone using illusions to improperly represent the night sky, or cast spells that produce effects similar to cosmic phenomenon.
