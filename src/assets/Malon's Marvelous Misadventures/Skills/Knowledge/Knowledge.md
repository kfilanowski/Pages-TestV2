[[INT]]-based [[Skill]]. You cannot roll Knowledge if you are not [[Proficiency|Trained]].

Knowledge is broken up into many different skills based on subject, and each one has a subsection dedicated to [[Monster Lore]] of specific types of creatures. Monster Lore isn’t its own skill, it is instead an action that uses the individual Knowledge skills. If a subject or creature falls into multiple categories, then players can choose whichever they like more, but an individual character can't roll multiple checks with different skills - instead, they receive a +2 bonus for each overlapping Knowledge they possess.

If you want to know who an individual creature is and their relevance to the world, rather than their stats and abilities, the [[DC]] is usually dependent on how popular they are. This is typically 30-[[LV]] with additional reductions to the DC if they are famous or in a position of power, or increases in the DC if they work to keep their identity and exploits hidden.

All Knowledge Skills can be used to recall the [[History]] of the associated subject as well, such as using [[Humanities]] to learn about ancient [[Elf]]-[[Human]] relations that shaped the current world.
