Use [[Nature]] to identify natural processes like photosynthesis, the reproduction of creatures, and tectonic activity. You can do things like figuring out if a volcano is about to erupt, what could be causing plants to die, or how long until an egg hatches.
You can also identify natural fauna, flora, and minerals, and their potential uses.
