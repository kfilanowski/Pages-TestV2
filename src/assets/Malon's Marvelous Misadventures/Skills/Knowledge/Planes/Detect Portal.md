Using [[Planes]], you can detect, identify, and disable portals.

Portals are strange phenomenon, but there are signs that they exist miles away from where the portal is actually located. If a portal is naturally occurring, you can use a [[DC]] 30 check to find its general area, or where it appears if it is not currently open. If it's manufactured, you can use a DC 20 check, or the caster's opposed [[Arcana]], whichever is higher.

In the presence of a portal, you can tell where its destination plane is. Rolling higher can give more specific locations, more details about the portals creation and how often it gets used. This starts at DC 10.

Disabling a portal is a task that is very difficult by one's self. Failure could mean getting stuck on the wrong side of the portal, or hyper-charging the portal to attract extraplanar creatures. Using Planes is usually a short-term and rushed method. The DC starts at 30. 

Using a [[Ritual]] with [[Invocation]] and [[Arcana]] can make the process of disabling a portal more safe.
