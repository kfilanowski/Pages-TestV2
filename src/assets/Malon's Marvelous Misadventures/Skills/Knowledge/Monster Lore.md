Adventurers are assumed to know basic things about monsters, like how a Construct's lack of anatomy grants them resistance to many effects, or the properties of Incorporeal creatures. Monster Lore checks are for figuring out more information about specific monster types, or if a creature is hiding its typing.

Monster stat blocks are broken up into sections. Basic stats ([[Saving Throw|Saves]], [[HP]] and [[AC]]), offense traits (breath weapons, dangerous auras, prominent spells), defense traits (healing abilities, elemental [[Resistance]]s), other traits (extra senses, extra movement options, out of combat abilities) and weaknesses/deep lore (lich's phylactery, vampires not appearing in mirrors).

Rolling a Monster Lore check is something you can do as a [[Free Action]] once per turn. It is assumed that you also vocalize what you learn to your team. The base [[DC]] of a Monster Lore check is (10+creature's [[LV]]). By succeeding on a Monster Lore check, you can figure out a creature's basic stats and one other category for your choice. For every 5 over the DC you roll, you figure out another category. If a creature has nothing in a category, you choose another.

Creatures with the [unique] tag in their entry increase their Monster Lore DC by 5. Humanoids with class levels by default are assumed to have the [unique] tag, unless their class comes with clearly distinguishable features (such as a [[Dark Knight]]'s [[Evil Eye]]), or they are part of an organization with similar training and abilities (such as a [[Monk]] dojo or city guards).
