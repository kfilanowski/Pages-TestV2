By observing a [[Spell]] as it is being cast, you can [[Instant Action|Instantly]] use [[Arcana]] to identify which Spell it is. The [[DC]] is 5 per level of the [[Technique]] (not including [[Upcast]].)

This is useful for determining whether you want to take action in response, or it has no immediate effect - though many Spells do not need to be identified if you already know the spell.

You may use [[Astronomy]] to identify [[Lunar]] spells, and [[Nature]] to identify [[Gaia]] spells.
