Using [[Athletics]], you can use Brute Force when there are no lockpicks or beasts of burden to handle your problems. The [[DC]] to break apart an object is modified by its quality, materials, and size. Substantial failure may cause back problems.

You can also use Athletics to represent bursts of strength that allow you to surpass your normal [[Carry Weight]] to shift large objects.
