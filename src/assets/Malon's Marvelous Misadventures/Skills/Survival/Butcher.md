Spend a minute to use [[Survival]] to skin, drain, dress, and otherwise harvest the organic components from a recently killed creature.

Obtaining organic loot from creatures is an important part of the game. Creatures that have listed drops when butchered will always give these items without a check if there is not a listed [[DC]].
Any organic materials that reasonably spoil will do so if not used in a timely manner (varies based off the part, but no less than 3 days). 

Using Survival to get additional resources beyond what is listed in a creature's entry grants materials worth an amount equal to the creature's [[LV]]^2 times 10. This has a DC of 10+creature's LV. At the DM's discretion, the harvest can be worth more or less or made easier or harder depending on the rarity of the creature and demand for its products.
