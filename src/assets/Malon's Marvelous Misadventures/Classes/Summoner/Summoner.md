Summoners are diverse spellcasters that focus on their ability to summon powerful creatures to their aid with greater ease and effect than others. Their signature ability is that of summoning an Avatar, a typically extraplanar being that is bonded to the Summoner, which can be far more powerful and useful than a typical summoned creature. Their bond allows them to share abilities, allowing superior self-contained teamwork.

All Summoner abilities are [[Supernatural]].

**1 - Techniques**

You gain 2 technique points at level 1, then another 2 points every 2 levels after. These technique points can be used on any path.

You gain full progression in Academy.

**1 - Planar Avatar** [[Summoning]], [[Companion]]

You gain the service of a specific outsider on your journey. See more in the [[Avatar]] section. 

[[Standard Action]], [[Recharge]]. You may summon or dismiss your Avatar without any equipment or staff needed. It is assumed your [[Summoning Contract]] is embedded into your and their bodies, such as in the form of a tattoo. There are no limits to how many times you can summon them, or for how long. Should they be [[Defeated]], they gain [[Summoning Sickness]]. However, you can choose to self-inflict [[Drained]] 2 during a long rest to remove the condition from them prematurely. 

Your Avatar is usually assumed to be from another plane of existence, such as a demon from the pits of hell. It can summon you to its aid just as you can. While summoned, an Avatar has a leash range of 5000. If it leaves this range, it is dismissed. 

Unless you arrange with your DM for your Avatar to have its own busy life, it is assumed to always be available to be summoned at a moment's notice. Work with your DM to ensure the way it is incorporated into the game is to your liking. It's okay to have an Avatar that has no responsibilities on its home plane, and is otherwise not an important part of the story. It's a major part of your character, after all.
