[[Summoner]] [[Archetype]].
Spirit Walkers are those that specialize in harnessing the power of malevolent fiends from the material plane. They invoke these beings to impose their will upon their enemies and the world to achieve their objectives. While the summoned spirits, fiends, and planar creatures are typically evil, these abilities can be employed for either good or ill.

You can use unique rituals to call specific powerful fiends to your side, or to influence your fate.

 **1 - Adversary Kishin Shōkan**

Requesting Adversity from a [[Adversary Kishin]] is a one minute ritual.

When invoking a Kishin, you are choosing to deliberately and unequivocally escalate the difficulty of a particular quest or journey. You must clearly communicate your desires and plan, knowing the Kishin's sole purpose is your suffering and demise. Each wish you make to it grants tougher challenges, and should you overcome these additional challenges, proportionally greater rewards. It functions by manipulating fate, making your journey difficult through united foes, prepared adversaries, and inherent animosity. You can only choose the amount of hardship to inflict upon yourself; the Kishin decides how this hardship manifests. The Kishin grants suffering of any scale, from mild annoyances to lethal curses.

The most common method it uses is to cause all of your enemies to converge on you at once. The second most common method is adding an army of undead to the ranks of your enemies, either through simple alliance, or by animating your foes the moment they are defeated.

**Kishin Characteristics**

The Kishin is a fierce deity of hardship and calamity. It aims to amplify bloodshed and amplify your torment. On manifestation, it appears as a translucent humanoid with short horns, adorned in elaborate robes, and blindfolded. Its sinister smile, bearing shark-like teeth, is its only distinct feature.

Kishin may manifest physically to deliver aid to your foes in person.
