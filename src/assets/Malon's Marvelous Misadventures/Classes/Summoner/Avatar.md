An Avatar is a creature that is bound to a Summoner, and vice versa. Use the following to determine its statistics. Its statistics are not reduced from being a summoned creature.

For ease of play reasons, it is assumed that your Avatar generally does as you wish, and that you are allowed to control all of its actions in combat, though it does still have a will of its own.
