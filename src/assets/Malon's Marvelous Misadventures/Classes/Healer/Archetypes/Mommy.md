**~={purple}1 - [[Hug]]=~** [[Supernatural]]
When you initiate a [[Grab]] on an enemy, they are [[Pacified]] for 1 round instead of the usual effects.
You can [[Mana Burn]] 1 to hug an ally as a [[Standard Action]], putting them in [[Stasis]] for one round, and removing any [[Fear]] effects.

**~={purple}1 - Emotional Support=~** [[Healing]]
Mom can remove any tier 1 [[Affliction]] with 1 hour of coddling. At levels 4 and 8, this can remove tier 2 and 3 Afflictions, respectively.

You gain a unique T1 Affliction: [[Mom'd Out]]. Other moms cannot remove this Affliction with Emotional Support.

**~={blue}1 - Mommy's Favorites=~** 
Mom says she doesn't play favorites, but we all know that’s a lie. Everybody must fight for Mom's favor. Mom keeps track of all the good things her children (everybody) do.

Any creature that gains at least 10 XP while performing tasks for you gains the ability to use [[Sending]] as an [[Innate Technique]], but only to contact you.

**~={blue}1 - Aura of Sheltering=~**
Enemies must make Will saves to take offensive actions against allies in your Protective Aura.
This lasts until an enemy successfully passes, or you or your allies attack. It is restored on [[Recharge]].
