Explorers are the generalist healers with a handful of utility abilities that assist with travel. They promote treating creatures with mercy whenever possible, and in the most extreme examples, can make death impossible. Their aura is powerful enough that existing near them makes you safer.

**~={blue}1 - Aura of Mercy=~** [[Supernatural]]
Creatures in your ~={red}Protective Aura=~ cannot die.

This aura has a distinct, personalized visual component that interferes with stealth.

**~={purple}1 - Lucky Break=~**
[[Immediate Action]], [[At-Will]]. Add [[LUK]] to a [[Roll]] in your ~={red}Protective Aura=~.
You cannot add LUK twice to a given Roll.

**~={blue}1 - Compassion=~** [[Mind-Affecting]]
When you use [[Channel Energy]], enemies in range that were aggressors/not acting in self-defense are [[Pacified]] for 5 rounds ([[Will]] negates). They get a new save at the end of their turns if you or your allies take aggressive actions versus their allies, and it ends immediately if you or your allies take aggressive actions towards them.

If there are no enemies left, initiative ends, and this ability can be extended for up to 10 minutes as long as you try resolving the conflict peacefully.

**~={blue}2 - Cure=~** [[Supernatural]] [[Healing]]
When you use [[Healing Touch]], creatures get a new save against any lingering effects that would normally give additional saves (such as [[Poisoned]] and some [[Mind-Affecting]] effects). Does not apply to permanent status like [[Cursed]] or [[Drained]].

**~={blue}2 - Endure Elements=~**
Creatures that touch your ~={red}Aura of Mercy=~ receive a blessing for 1 hour. This blessing allows them to exist inside of otherwise hazardous environments without harm. Blessed creatures ignore environmental effects like toxic volcanic gas, thin air at extreme heights, extremes in temperature, the vacuum of space or the pressure/lack of air in underwater environments.

This does not make you immune to hazardous weather, such as hail, windstorms, lightning, or quicksand; only passive effects that prevent you from existing are blocked.

**~={purple}4 - [[Mystic Door]]=~** [[Supernatural]] [[Teleportation]]
One Minute Cast Time, [[Limited]]. When you rest in a settlement of at least 100 people, you can mark one of the doorways, portals, or similar entrance in the place you rested as your Mystic Doorstep.

As long as you are within 10 miles of the place you slept, you can conjure a Mystic Door that links to the Mystic Doorstep for one minute. It is the same size as the entry you marked.

It takes one minute to cast. Any creature can take the portal back simply by walking through it, but it is one-way. Once the Mystic Door disappears, so does your Mystic Doorstep.

This effect does not require line of sight.

**~={purple}4 - [[Focus Dispel]]=~** [[Supernatural]]
[[Standard Action]], [[Recharge]]. Touch a creature. On an ally, one harmful [[Spell]] or Supernatural effect immediately ends, unless it is permanent. On an enemy, this functions as [[Dispel]]. For cursed items, this allows the safe removal of the item, but requires a caster level check.

**~={purple}6 - [[Blessing of Restoration]]=~** [[Supernatural]] [[Healing]]
You recover from all stacks of [[Drained]] every time you rest, regardless of conditions.

As a [[Standard Action]], you can touch a creature to transfer a stack of Drained from them to yourself. A creature can only be affected by this once each week.

**~={blue}8 - [[Elemental Protection]]=~** [[Supernatural]]
Gain resistance to a [[Damage]] type, except for [[Magic]]. Allies in your aura also gain this.

You can change what you're resistant to when you [[Short Rest]].

**~={blue}10 - Angel Ray=~**
Your [[Holy Arrow]] applies [[Focus Dispel]], and has +10 Range.
