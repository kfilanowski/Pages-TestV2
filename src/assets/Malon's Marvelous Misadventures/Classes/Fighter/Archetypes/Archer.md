[[Fighter]] [[Archetype]].

Archers are the elite skirmishers and hunters that inundate their enemies with a rain of arrows. They are the leaders from afar, providing covering fire for allies while keeping a watchful eye on the battlefield.

This archetype replaces Armor Training and changes the Techniques.

1 - Techniques

You gain full progression in [[Marksmanship]] and [[Warfare]].

1 - Arrow Burst

When making a Superior Attack with a Bow weapon, your attack also strikes a 5-foot radius around the primary target.
This functions as [[Arrow Rain]], [[At-Will]]. It also benefits from the Upcast damage when you reach the appropriate levels.
Allies in the radius are not subject to the attack.

1 - Sharp Eyes [[Buff]]

[[Standard Action]], [[At-Will]]. Grant a touched ally +10 [[Crit]] Rate and +d6 [[Critical Damage]] for 10 minutes. Up to 3+[[CHA]] allies can benefit at the same time.
This Buff ends when you are Defeated.

You gain this benefit passively.
