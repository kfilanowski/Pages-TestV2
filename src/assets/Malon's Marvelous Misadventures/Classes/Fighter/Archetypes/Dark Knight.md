[[Fighter]] [[Archetype]].

Stand stalwart in the face of danger, an immovable obstacle that your opponents must fight tooth and nail to merely walk past, let alone survive. Outside of combat your massive skill bonuses can allow you to sense what others don't, and sniff out liars.

Based on the Maplestory class of the same name.

**~={blue}1 - Evil Eye=~** [[Supernatural]]
You can manifest an ominous looking eye that floats around you, enhancing your senses and giving you a palpable aura of menace. You get [[Proficiency]] in [[Intimidation]] and [[Insight]]. You get a 4+½[[LV]] bonus to [[Perception]], [[Insight]] and [[Intimidation]]. You also add this bonus against uses of [[Intimidation]] against you.

You can choose to make this eye disappear once per turn as a [[Free Action]], but you lose the bonuses to [[Perception]] and [[Intimidation]].

**~={blue}1 - No Escape=~**
All effects that grant [[Elusive]] [[movement]] do not function against you while you wield a reach weapon, allowing you to make [[AoO|AoOs]] against a much larger number of creatures.

If a creature tries to move around you safely using [[Acrobatics]] while you wield a reach weapon, you add your ~={red}Evil Eye=~ bonus to your [[Reflex]] against them.

**~={purple}1 - [[Hyper Body]]=~**
Passive. You get a +4 bonus to [[Fortitude]]. Your [[HP]] increases by 6+4/[[LV]].

[[Standard Action]], [[At-Will]]. [[Buff]]. Touched ally gains an additional 4/[[LV]] [[HP]] for 10 minutes. This is based on their level. Up to 3+[[CHA]] allies can benefit at once.
This buff ends when you are [[Defeated]].

**~={blue}2 - Stalwart=~**
You take half damage from [[Fortitude]] [[Saving Throw|Saves]]. When you pass a fort save, it deals no damage and has no additional effect.

**~={blue}4 - Polearm Mastery=~**
You can make an unlimited number of [[AoO|AoOs]], and they have +4 [[ACC]].

**6 -** **Dread** [[Fear]]
Enemies that end their turn in your reach must make [[Will]] saves or be [[Shaken]] 1. [[Minion|Minions]] do not get a save.

**~={purple}8 - Dark Impale=~** [[Supernatural]] [[Concentration]]
[[Action-Attack]], [[At-Will]]. [[Attack]] with a [[Pierce]] reach weapon. On hit, you leave a phantom copy of your weapon in the creature. The creature is unable to leave your natural [[reach]] and is [[Anchored]]. You can still use your weapon, but it is otherwise subject to [[Concentration]] rules, and the effect ends if you or the target are moved out of reach. 

If you impale a second creature, the first is freed.
