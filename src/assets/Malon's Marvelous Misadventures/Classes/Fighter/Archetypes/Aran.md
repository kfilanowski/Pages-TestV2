[[Fighter]] [[Archetype]].

Cleave through waves of enemies, eventually gaining the strength to spin through entire armies. Aran is the premier AoE DPS martial.

**~={purple}1 - Smash Swing=~**
You can use [[Great Cleave]] at-will. 
This special attack becomes Smash Swing.

**~={blue}1 - Combat Step=~** [[Elusive]]
If you [[Defeat]] an enemy during ~={red}Smash Swing=~, you may activate Combat Step as a Swift Action to move an additional 10 feet without spending your movement. You can continue ~={red}Smash Swing=~ from the new location.
At level 2, you can ~={red}Combat Step=~ an additional time after the first as a [[Free Action]].
At level 4, ~={red}Combat Step=~ is a [[Free Action]].

As long as you don't move or take any additional actions after ~={red}Smash Swing=~, you can use any other attacks you get from your weapon's [[AS]] or ~={red}Superior Attacks=~ to Defeat an enemy and qualify for ~={red}Combat Step=~. 

**~={blue}2 - Combo=~**
After [[defeat|Defeating]] an enemy with a melee [[Attack]], you get another ~={red}Superior Attack=~ that must be used before the end of your turn (doesn't work off-turn).

**~={blue}4 - Body Pressure=~**
You can attack all group-type enemies normally and without penalty, and deal double damage to them. In addition, you cannot be flanked.

**~={blue}6 - Combo Drain=~** [[Healing]]
Striking an enemy with Smash Swing heals 2 hp.
Only works in the adrenaline of true combat. Not even sparring triggers this.

**~={blue}8 - Aero Swing=~**
If you ~={red}Smash Swing=~ while in the air, you may spend all of your remaining movement to hover in place until the start of your next turn. You may use this to [[Fly]] using your ~={red}Combat Steps=~, should you [[Defeat]] enemies in the air.

**~={blue}10 - Adrenaline Rush=~**
~={red}Superior Attacks=~ deal maximum damage against opponents you struck with ~={red}Smash Swing=~ on the same turn.
