A Marauder focuses on aggressive movement to strike weak targets, surprising back lines and avoiding threats to gain unfair advantages.

[[Swift Action]], [[At-Will]]. [[Dash]]. You can run on walls or ceilings with this movement. You fall at the end of your turn if you are not on the ground.

**~={blue}1 - Maim=~**
When you hit a [[Surprised]] creature, perform an [[AoO]], or succeed at a [[Combat Maneuver]], the target's [[Speed]] is reduced by 5, stacking. This lasts until they spend a [[Standard Action]] or an ally uses [[Aid]], which removes one stack.
If their Speed is reduced to 0, your next hit against them cripples them permanently, inflicting [[Affliction - Hamstringed]]. 

**1 - Stowaway**
You gain [[Hide in Plain Sight]] when holding or using containers as cover. 

2 - Sure Footing
Your movement isn't slowed by difficult terrain, and you need not make checks to keep your balance in precarious situations, such as when stepping on ice or grease.
