**1 - Vital Spirit**
When below half [[HP]], Gain [[FH]] 1.

**1 -** **Haymaker**
[[Action-Attack]], [[Recharge]]. Can only be used below half HP.
Gain [[Temp HP]] equal to a quarter of your [[HP]] until the start of your next turn, and deal the same amount as [[Magic]] [[Damage]] in a 30ft cone ([[Reflex]] halves).
You can target one creature in melee range with an [[Unarmed]] [[Attack]], which deals its damage and applies a -2 penalty to their save. The cone then originates from them.

**2 - Skull Breaker**
On your turn, when you land Unarmed Attacks against two different creatures, are Grabbing two creatures, or do some combination of Attacks, Combat Maneuvers, or Grabs, you pull them adjacent to each other and attempt to Stun them for one round (Fortitude negates).

Once stunned, a given creature is not susceptible to being Stunned again until you Recharge.

**2 - Meat Shield**
[[Immediate Action]], Recharge. When targeted with an attack, redirect the attack to a creature that you are Grabbing.

**4 - Flying Pigs**
Gain Foe Throw as an Innate Technique. You can use it as a Free Action. You can apply Skull Breaker when you hit two targets.

**4 - Convincing Fists**
Gain +4 Intimidation against creatures you have hit with an Unarmed Attack since you last rested.

**6 - No Guard**
[[Free Action]], [[At-Will]]. Provoke an [[AoO]]. If anyone chooses to take their shot, they automatically hit you, but they also Provoke from you, and you can automatically hit them if you so choose.
This can be combined with Haymaker to use it as a Free Action and automatically land the Unarmed Attack.

**8 - Bulk Up**
On any round you do not make an Attack or cast a Spell, you gain Resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn.

**10 - Showstopper**
Action-Attack, Limited. Become Unstoppable as you move up to your speed and snatch a creature, and continue moving up to your speed in a straight line with the creature as you carry them through the air.

When you land, the target and adjacent creatures take your Haymaker damage and are Staggered (Fortitude halves and negates).
