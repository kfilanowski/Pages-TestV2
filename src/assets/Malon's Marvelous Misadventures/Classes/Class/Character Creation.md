There are several things for you to decide when deciding what you're writing down on your character sheet. Start with a theme, aesthetic, fighting style, or a particular character type you want to mimic from popular media.

These are in order of necessity for actually playing the game, but not necessarily in the order that is most convenient to any individual's workflow.


|     |                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 1   | [[Class]]          | Classes tend to be very specifically tailored to certain themes, often through the use of archetypes (subclasses).<br><br>Some classes have choices pre-built in, like what type of techniques you know, a martial artist's fighting style or a necromancer's starting minion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 2   | [[Race]]           | Races come with a variety of benefits. Primary race features help define what role they generally fit, while secondary features are generally more interchangeable. Human is kind of the "default" which is generally good for all characters and isn't very difficult to roleplay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3   | [[Ability Scores]] | All ability scores do something on their own, without considering effects from classes. Different classes tend to get different mileage from each choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 4   | [[Skill]]s         | Skills generally determine the type of things that your character does that are less specific. Rogues and ninjas might be known for stealth, but anybody can take the skill. Most skills are tailored towards out of combat interactions, but some, like athletics, stealth, and acrobatics, have a variety of applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 5   | [[Feat]]s          | Feats are customization options that usually give static bonuses, new options in combat, and generally serve to tailor your character towards a specific play style.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 6   | [[Background]]     | This section helps inform what your character was up to before they became an adventurer and provides you with unique sets of starting gear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 7   | [[Equipment]]      | Decide what type of weapons, armor, and equipment you want. All characters start off with 1,000g to spend as they wish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 8   | Backstory          | Think about what your character wants, the kinds of tie-ins they have to your world and the kinds of tragic events that happened that led to them brooding in corners of bars. Writing backstories can be fun, but you shouldn't feel obligated to write a specific number of pages or wordcount like it's some silly school assignment. How much you put into table top is how much you get out of it. The most important part of character design is making sure you, your DM and your players are all interested, or at the very least not annoyed, by your character. |
| 9   | [[Random Charts]]  | Under the random charts section, there is a "character creation" tab that allows you to decide details about your character if you are uncertain about how big or small, old or young you want your character to be.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
