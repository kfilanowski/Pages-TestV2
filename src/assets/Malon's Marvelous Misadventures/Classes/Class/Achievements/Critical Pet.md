[[Achievement]]
==Requirement== - Use stealth to initiate combat on a creature by patting its head 3 times. This pat can have no mechanical effect such as delivering a spell or attacking.

==Reward== - You unlock the "Pet" skill. It uses your stealth bonus. If you sneak up on a creature and pet their head (again, no additional mechanical effect), you establish dominance, giving you a +2 bonus to skills for the subsequent social or combat encounter. If a creature within reach is smaller than you, you can pet them as a free action 1/turn for no mechanical benefit (no save).
