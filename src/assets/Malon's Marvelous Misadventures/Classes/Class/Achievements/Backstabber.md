[[Achievement]]
==Requirement== - Murder 3 people you once considered allies, or who at thought you were an ally (before you turned on them). If you murder someone in a position of great power, like a powerful guild leader or king, it counts as 3.

==Reward== - You have a 6th sense for when people trust you. By observing how they react to your presence in a brief interaction (such as an introduction), you can tell whether they trust you, are indifferent towards you or if they distrust you.
