Classes are the fundamental basis from which you obtain abilities.

Classes get a set of numerical bonuses to aid them. Every class has listed [[HP]], [[Skill]]s, [[Mana]], and at least one [[Saving Throw|Save]] bonus. Stats can be flat front-loaded amounts, per-[[LV]] bonuses, or both.

Most characters will get their core abilities front-loaded at level 1. All classes get access to some type of [[Technique|Techniques]], which can be martial techniques or spells. Technique points granted through class usually have some form of restriction.

Even levels are mostly dedicated to class features that directly increase the classes power. This includes gaining access to new combat abilities, increasing the power of old ones, and getting their own special attacks.

Odd levels are mostly dedicated to getting the next tier of techniques. As such, class features are usually sparse. If any are included, they are usually minor increases in power or they are flavorful inclusions. You also get a [[Feat]] every odd level.

Most classes require selecting an [[Archetype]] at level 1, which grants more specific thematic abilities.
