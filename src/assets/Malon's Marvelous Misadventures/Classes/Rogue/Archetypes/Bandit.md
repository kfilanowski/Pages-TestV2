[[Rogue]] [[Archetype]].
A professional thief, a blur of shadows around the battlefield taking everything their opponents have and stepping back before they realize what happened.
Your very shadow steps out to reach into people's pockets when they aren't looking.

**~={blue}1 - Pickpocket=~**

[[Crit|Crits]] drop coins around the target. When collected, roll [[Critical Damage]] to see how many you get; if you collect them, it's worth quadruple. You can collect the coins as a free action, but other creatures must spend an action to collect or otherwise move the money. Before it's looted or moved, the coins are ~={red}Blood Money=~. 

This ability represents taking something away from your opponent with each hit. If you use it while sparring or against allies to "farm" money, they may need that money back to replace the golden tooth they lost, jewelry you pilfered, the kidney you stole etc.

[[DM]] discretion.

**~={blue}1 - Cunning Action: Steal=~**

You can use ~={red}Cunning Action=~ to [[Steal]]. You can use Steal to produce ~={red}Blood Money=~ once per creature.
Your ~={red}Cunning Actions=~ have +10 reach.

**~={purple}1 - Coin Explosion (Recharge)=~**

Action-Attack. Explode ALL of your ~={red}Blood Money=~, dealing your [[Critical Damage]] for every pile exploded in their tiles and adjacent tiles. The damage stacks, including with overlap (Reflex halves). You are immune to this damage.

Even though each explosion is a separate instance of damage, creatures only roll their save once against all of them.

**~={blue}2 - Band of Thieves=~** [[Companion]] [[Summoning]]

You can easily find and hire goons to call upon for aid. These are humanoids with half your [[HP]] (including when summoned), and +1 [[DEX]] and [[LUK]]. They are half your level. They have no other abilities or statistics of their own (no techniques, feats, class features, etc).

You may equip them as you please, and Summon them as a ~={red}Cunning Action=~ as per a [[Summoning Contract]]. They take their turn on your turn - the player controls them.

They can use [[Steal]] and [[crit|Critical Hits]] to create Blood Money for you, using your statistics. They have their own limit for Steal.

**~={blue}4 - Grand Larceny=~**

When you use the [[Steal]] action, you can [[Steal]] from everything in reach.

**~={blue}4 - Coin Collection=~**

Gain ~={green}+20%=~ [[Wealth]].

**~={purple}6 - Assaulter=~** [[Teleportation]]

[[Action-Attack]], [[At-Will]]. Teleport to an enemy that is [[Surprised]], up to 30ft, and [[Attack]].

**~={blue}8 - Advanced Dark Sight=~**

[[Steal]] no longer ends ~={red}Dark Sight=~.
Natural [[Crit|Crits]] no longer end ~={red}Dark Sight=~.
