You gain full progression in Scoundrel and Warfare.

**~={purple}1 - Ability=~**

**~={blue}1 - Passive=~**

**~={blue}1 - Sneak Attack=~**

[[Surprised|Surprise]] [[Attack|Attacks]] have +20 [[Crit]] Chance. In most cases, this means all Surprise attack hits are Critical Hits - you have a 100% critical hit rate with them.

**~={blue}1 - Critical Edge**

Add another d10+[[LUK]] to your [[Critical Damage]].

**~={blue}1 - Backstep**

Once on your turn, during or after movement, you can move backwards on the path you took [[Elusive]] 10 ft without spending movement.

**~={blue}1 - Cunning Action**

Once per round, gain an additional [[Standard Action]] or [[Swift Action]] that can't be used to [[Attack]] or cast a [[Spell]]. This must be a different action than you use with your regular standard or swift action.

**~={purple}1 - [[Dark Sight]]**

[[Immediate Action]], [[Recharge]]. Gain the ability to use [[Stealth]] anywhere and [[Hide]] on the same action, as well as cause all [[ACC|Accuracy]] checks against you to fail. Lasts five turns, or until you [[Attack]], cast a [[Spell]], or otherwise take an offensive action. Creatures that are not using [[Detect]] do not get additional checks to spot you.

**~={purple}1 - [[Haste]]=~** [[Buff]]

[[Standard Action]], [[At-Will]]. Grant a touched ally +10 [[Speed]] and [[Jump]] for 10 minutes. Up to 3+[[CHA]] allies can benefit at the same time.

**~={blue}2 - Evasion**

**~={blue}2 - Rogue Talent**

You gain a [[Rogue Talent]] every even level.

**~={blue}4 - Stroke of Luck**

(1+[[LUK]]) times per day, you can force a specific serendipitous event as a free action. Advantageous scenarios could be something like a cart of hay to catch your fall, or a bird smashing into a window to get a guard to investigate. Things with a DC of 15 or lower happens automatically. Anything higher requires a roll.

**~={blue}6 - Uncanny Dodge**

[[Stealth]], [[Blinded|Blindness]], and [[Invisible|Invisibility]] do not cause attacks to [[Surprised|Surprise]] you.

**~={blue}8 - Reliable Talent**

If you [[Roll]] less than 10 on a [[Skill]] check, instead roll a 10.
