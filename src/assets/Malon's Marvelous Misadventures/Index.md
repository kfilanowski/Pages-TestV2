## [[🍔 Mission Statement]]
Malon's Marvelous Misadventures is a TTRPG where the players take on the roles of capable adventurers in a fantasy world, facing off against the odds themselves as they plow through hordes and chow down on the rewards! It's centered on systems that maximize the ease of content creation and compatibility with what exists in other tactical TTRPGs.

The content provided will be enough to run relatively lighthearted fantasy games, and serves as a basis to create more and adapt it to your needs. The game mechanics are a blend of real-world intuition and game-y themes, setting a stage with a healthy amount of suspension of disbelief to allow more creative solutions to problems without worrying too much about adherence to realism.
