| Spiritual Guardian | Kitsune often live in and protect shrines of spiritual significance, which are common targets for fiendish creatures.<br>As long as a kitsune's home shrine is safe and well-maintained, they can use it to travel to an associated spirit or deity's plane of existence (usually in the Fey Wilds) as if using [[Plane Shift]] on themselves. This is a safe haven, often connected to secret villages of Kitsune.<br>If they are [[Defeated]] while their shrine is safe, they instantly disappear to the safety of their plane of existence. They may return to the mortal realm after a week, appearing at their shrine.<br>If a kitsune's shrine is destroyed, they must find or build a new one. There is an expectation that a kitsune serves their shrine - neglect will surely anger the spirits and gods. |
