| Unending Generation [[Companion]] | The Usa's greatest strength is their unparalleled reproduction speed, ability to learn, and rate of growth, even without the presence of a partner. This allows for a unique approach to life, where offspring are kept in the presence of the Usa and treated as a single person until the parent dies. <br>When an Usa dies, their strongest offspring immediately takes their place, inheriting all of their abilities and Level. The offspring use their time with their parent and other offspring to learn everything about their collective life, allowing them to continue the life of their parent as if they were the same person, though lacking specific details in their memory. <br>An Usa with this ability always has several offspring nearby. All of them must be slain to truly "kill" the parent.<br>An Usa with this ability gets an unlimited amount of [[LV]] 0 [[Commoner]] Usa as Companions, restocking after every [[Rest]].<br><br>Usa that stray from their parent become dissociated individuals. |

They are usually adults by 3 months, and live up to 10 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Appearance and Biology | Usa have very little diversity in their physical appearance. They are almost universally small, lithe, and pale, sporting long rabbit ears and large red or black eyes. They often have additional luxurious fur on their necks and extremities, and dense voluminous hair. Usa look almost identical to their parents without fail, making lineage easy to identify.<br><br>Almost all Usa are female or hermaphrodites with extreme fertility. Their ability to multiply is their main method of survival, and doing so comes as easily as breathing to them. This is paired with an innate aloof disposition and lack of self preservation. They often have so many offspring that they don't care to keep track of them, and the fear of death has less value to their survival than the desire to breed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Pest Control           | Ancient Usa ancestors survived by minimizing their impact on their environments, hiding, and ensuring their children would live to see another day when the Links were being hunted to extinction.<br><br>The most successful among them were the smallest, fastest, and most efficient kin. Hiding turned into predator satiation, and protecting children turned into sacrifice for the good of the group. After enough time, the Usa simply accepted that they were hunted for sport, and stopped worrying about minimizing their footprints. They unapologetically swarmed resources, knowing full well it made them easy to find.<br><br>In modern times, Usa Half-Links are often still mercilessly hunted, as their overwhelming numbers can cause serious problems when their leadership figures don't have conservation on the mind. At the same time, this continued aggression from other races radicalizes the larger Usa clans, and retaliatory Usa uprisings have been known to tear countries apart in short-term conflicts. This cycle of lifestyle and violence is an inevitable fact for most Usa. |
