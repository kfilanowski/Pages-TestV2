| Round Grace              | Bambuken are deceptively agile for their size, and can easily roll onto their feet to keep their momentum going.<br>They don't lose any speed while [[Prone]], don't need to spend movement to stand up, and have +4 [[AC]] vs [[Fell]].<br>They also ignore the first 30 Ft of [[Fall Damage]], and generally don't take damage from bumping into things when falling down steep slopes. |

| Appearance and Biology | Bambuken are large and wide heavyset people, with the black and white patterns of pandas. They tend to have far more fat and muscle than other races, and dense soft fur on their arms and backs. <br><br>Despite their size and weight, Bambuken are soft, flexible, and mobile. They can climb, roll, and dodge like any smaller race can. Their spines are capable of maintaining a spherical pose to roll down hills, and their dense bones are built to withstand the impacts created by their weight. |
