| Hybrid Form (Su) Chimeric [[Polymorph]] | As a standard action, you can change your appearance along the gradient between humanoid and beast, ranging from anthropomorphic animal to humanoid with only minor features hinting at your heritage, such as ears and tail. This transformation lasts indefinitely. Transforming back is also a standard action. You always look like yourself. You can only change how much of you is humanoid, and how much is beast. All combinations are still within your "true" form. |
| [[Night Vision]]                        | You treat dim light as bright light. You treat darkness as dim light.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Adorable - [[Mind-Affecting]] [[Emotion]] | Your ancestors became pets to survive. You lack the physique of a typical Half-Link, instead possessing a soft, nonthreatening cuddly appearance. As long as you aren't aggressive and have taken no actions to further a combat, intelligent creatures must make [[Will]] saves the first time they attack you. If they fail, they hesitate and cannot complete their turn. [[Undead]] and [[Fiend\|Fiends]] gain a +10 bonus to this. |

| Size and Age                            | Half-Links are incredibly diverse. However, most lineages have a maximum size of around 4', and weigh around 70 lbs. The most short-lived lineages grow incredibly rapidly until they reach maturity at 1, and then live until 20, or 35 with good health. The longer lifespans tend to reach maturity at 15, and then live until 100.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Appearance and Biology                  | Many Half-Links have a gradient of form, ranging from mostly-animal or even completely feral to humanoids with minor aesthetics (such as ears and tail) or indistinguishable from other humanoids. However, many others have no control over their appearance, and are stuck in a middle ground between a particular humanoid race (usually human or elf) and their animal ancestry. <br><br>Half-Links tend to be druids, barbarians, and other wild peoples as a consequence of their pasts, so most that are not integrated into civilization will wear pelts and plant matter, if anything at all. Half-Links that are integrated into society will tend to wear whatever culture they are closest to within that society to fit in. Half-Links tend to appear small, almost childlike in their youthful appearances, and tend towards being incredibly athletic and muscular in build. As they age, their humanoid parts still tend to remain young, but their animal aspects will wither and grey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Origins                                 | The Half-Links originated from animals in the distant past. They were subject to an obscure, primordial phenomenon known as Primal Sentience. This rare occurrence grants random animals a spark of consciousness, later culminating in a high degree of intelligence and understanding of the world equal to a human, as well as physical abilities far beyond any other of their species.<br><br>These creatures were initially viewed as malevolent entities, tricksters and puppet-things of spellcasters and demons through which harm was inflicted on crops and societies. These beliefs were founded on real events, as many of them appeared from the wilderness and preyed on livestock and children, or mimicked common speech to scare away or, rarely, converse with strangers that wandered into their territory.<br><br>As time passed and understanding of these beings grew, powerful druidic circles took it upon themselves to cultivate their integration into society. They were able to seek and collect the rare animals and give them an opportunity to learn common speech, culture, and knowledge, and with that they were able to reach a level of proficiency in ability and magic similar to humanoid races. This was an incredible undertaking, requiring the hands of some of the most powerful individuals in the world, with the guidance of the gods above and below. <br><br>The final step in their integration was a study of druidic magic. The same magic that allowed druids to shape change into animals was used by those magic animals to change into humanoids, giving them a nearly seamless transition into personhood as it was recognized by those around them. For a long time, their unique talents and perspectives put them at the forefront of magical research, entering civilization as part of the middle and upper class. They were then known as The Links. |
| The Great Hunt and Devolution           | While the Links changed culturally and physically as their descendants acclimated to living with the other races, the culture and tradition of the other races were far too slow to change. A backlash from those who still perceived the Links as abominations from deeply entrenched superstitions ultimately led to their widespread persecution. Entire crusades were established in opposition to their sudden rise to power, fueled by conspiracies built on folklore and disgust at the intermingling of Links and humanoids in an equal setting. <br><br>In a blink of history, the Links and the druidic circles that helped them went from a well-established collection of powerful enclaves, to nothing. The relentless pursuit and slaughter of these individuals, generations of separation from their primal origins, enslavement, and the suppression of their innate magical abilities caused the total degeneration and extinction of the Links, resulting in the fragmented, diminished forms that exist today. Those who managed to evade this cataclysm were forced to isolate themselves, adopt human guise, or interbreed for survival, completing the final severing of ties with their ancestral heritage. Eventually, all that remained were the Half-Links; smaller, weaker, more mundane, and otherwise pathetic when compared to what they once were.<br><br>The majority of modern Half-Links inherited but a fraction of their forebears' magical capacities, leading to the present-day diversity of tribes and the varied, often unstable, expression of their abilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Tribal Lineages and Regional Variations | Fast-forward through now-ancient history, and specific Half-Link tribes have emerged, each with their own distinct characteristics, traditions, and magical inclinations. These tribes, often defined by their animalistic ancestry, reflect the divergent paths taken by various Half-Link ancestors. While some remain largely isolated, others have adapted to their environments and forged uneasy alliances with humanoid societies. <br><br>To most, specific tribes of Half-Links are their own separate, unrelated race. Over time, many groups have carved out niches for themselves with the abilities they inherited, evolving into something completely unlike what their ancestors were. They created their own cultures and abilities in these offshoots, resulting in modern groups such as the Kitsune and Lamia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Never Again                             | Primal Sentience still exists. There are still occurrences of spontaneous intelligence in animals. However, the druidic magic, common ancestors, individuals, and even the gods that made the Links were lost to the extinction and time. While it's not impossible to recreate what was lost, nobody has attempted (or even had the means) to bring them back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
