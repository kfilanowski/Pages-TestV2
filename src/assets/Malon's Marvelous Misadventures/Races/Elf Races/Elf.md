| Size and Age            | Elves are typically around 5' tall and 100 Lbs. They age about the same rate as humans do, but once they grow to size, they do not die of old age, nor do they get any health complications from old age.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Appearance and Biology  | Elves are lithe androgynous humanoids with long pointed ears as their most telling feature. In their youth, elves possess an eerie beauty, appearing as idealized and flawless beings in the eyes of humans. Most are light-skinned with green eyes, but they come in a variety of shades and hues that reflect the environments in which they were born.<br><br>They become adults at about the same speed as humans, but when they grow older, they physically change based on things like their environment or their magical affinity instead of becoming wrinkled and feeble. Forest hermits might start growing leaves and branches, stag horns or feathers. A wizard that specializes in Cryomancy might turn a light shade of blue and grow cold to the touch. Changing in physical properties like these typically happen over the course of many years.<br><br>Elves do not reproduce often due to a combination of low fertility, low libido, and cultural pressures due to their lifespan. Most elves can only conceive in the presence of natural magic, such as during celestial events or in blessed springs. Because of this, they are quite a rare sight outside of their settlements.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Ageless                 | Elves are unique among humanoids due to their endless youth. They develop a very different perception of time and the world at large. While a generation of humans might pass every 20 years or so, a generation of elves often lasts over a century. As such, they have a unique perspective on the rise and fall of empires, world level crises, and the passage of time in general. Elves possess a unique form of wisdom that can either be used to aid other races, or cause them to become jaded as they see the same pattern of self destruction emerge multiple times amongst the humanoid societies they observe.<br><br>Long life isn't all sunshine and rainbows. Elves can often develop a superiority complex, considering they are usually the smartest or wisest person in any given room. Yearly celebrations such as birthdays are largely ignored. Elves making friends with non elves is a rarity, since they won't stick around long enough to matter anyway. Elves can often seem apathetic towards the plights of other humanoids, but their reactions have merely been tempered by experience. Many will hide for the rest of eternity, minimizing the risks to their health until they feel there is something important enough to emerge for.<br><br>Because elven society moves much more slowly than other humanoids, many of their practices can seem archaic, time-consuming and inconvenient. They are often purposefully designed to be so in order to make them take more time and be more inconvenient to replicate for other races. "See you again soon" takes on an entirely different meaning as the elf's perception of time is likely wildly different than what most non-elven creatures think. They tend to be much more conservative than others, adhering to ancient traditions and worshiping less popular or older deities.  <br><br>Everybody is a kid at some point, so they understand what it was like to some degree: What it is like to feel wonder in a world filled with the unknown. At some point people grow and the wonder and discovery of childhood is filled with responsibility and routine of adulthood. Elves eventually come to exist on some 3rd plateau of existence where they have eaten every food, vacationed in every country, saved the world, started a family, lost people they loved, turned to the dark side and were eventually redeemed and all the rest. Once you experience so much of what the world has to offer, once you have given so much of yourself to the world only to be forgotten, what is the meaning of your continued existence? |
| Obsession               | The aforementioned appearance changes are merely an outward representation of decades, maybe even centuries of obsession, and their effects on the individual's soul. When traditional methods of acquiring meaning in one's life fail, elves have all the time in the world to dedicate to their projects. Spiteful elves may eventually have their conscious eroded to the point where the short-lived races are viewed as mice in their experiments, and are transformed into monsters. They might develop an entirely selfless desire to protect the natural world and view most any inhabitants that exploit it as a virus to be cured by any means necessary. Maybe at a young age they are exposed to a great evil and tirelessly work to exterminate it, and snuff out any reemergence for as long as they live.<br><br>Turning people into monsters is abhorrent, and hunting demons is noble. Protecting nature is a lofty ideal, but usually most humanoids are only willing to go as far is needed to maintain their way of life: Appeasing the spirits for safety, enriching the soil for crops etc. So a single-minded dedication to nature could easily cause conflict once one too many trees are cut. These exceptionally long-lived elves that develop obsessions don't necessarily cause conflict, but depending on their obsession, they very easily could. Entire elven societies form around these obsessions, for better or worse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| The Princess Adventurer | Age causes the perception of elves to warp as they gain life experience, but elves in their youth have no such experience. Young elves are rebellious towards elven traditions in the same way children of other races are to their parents, as the reality of their immortality takes decades to set in. <br><br>Young elves (usually between ages 20 and 100) are often hard to distinguish from humans in terms of personality archetypes. They are usually more reserved, but are otherwise capable of taking risks that older elves learn to avoid. They are the most likely to travel the world and engage in dangerous adventures. This is where the visage of the stereotypical elf comes from: stories of fair elven princesses leaving their homes to see the world, still retaining that eerie beauty of their youth while being the oldest among their peers.<br><br>As they age, and the reality of their immortality sets in, young elves often regret the decisions they took in their rebellious years. Other races enjoy their lives while they have it, taking risks and making dumb decisions to make the best of it. Elves, on the other hand, will live long enough to regret their tattoos, their scars, and the enemies they made. "Permanent" means something very different to someone that will have to deal with the consequences of their actions for the next thousand years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
