| Size and Age           | Moon Elves are the same size as their terrestrial counterparts. While they have mass, they don't experience much pull from gravity, making them seem nearly weightless.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Appearance and Biology | Moon Elves remain extremely pale their entire lives. They tend to have cool-colored hair and brilliant eyes.<br><br>Like most Lunar creatures, Moon Elves have gemstones or minerals in their bodies through which their adaptive magic flows. In most cases, this manifests as golden adornments on their heads, the most famous example being the Moon Princess' golden horns. |
