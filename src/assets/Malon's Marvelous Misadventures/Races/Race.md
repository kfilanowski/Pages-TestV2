Races are a classification similar to creature type, mainly tailored towards players. They are the various sapient species and beings that inhabit the setting. When creating a character, players typically choose a race to determine their character's physical appearance, unique abilities, cultural background, and narrative possibilities.

Most races have a racial language, but also know common. All creatures are assumed to have a base speed of 30ft, know [[Language|Common]], and be Medium in [[Size and Reach|Size]] unless otherwise stated.

The lore used to describe races is to differentiate a given race from the others. It also gives people a starting point if they don't know how to roleplay or world build with a specific race.

The descriptions you find here (or in any source really) are tailored to a specific setting, or are the brain child of some other fantasy obsessed weirdo. They do not need to match how a specific race exists in your world if you have something else in mind.

| Component          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Traits             | These usually cover some of the race basics, such as creature type and starting languages. Some races come with a specific feature baked in that can't be exchanged. You will know if a race has this when they only have 1 major or minor feature. |
| Major Features     | Default 2 per race. These are the heavy hitting features that generally aren't shared between races and have a major impact on gameplay.                                                                                                            |
| Minor Features     | Default 2 per race. These are the heavy hitting features that generally aren't shared between races and have a major impact on gameplay.                                                                                                            |
| Alternate Features | Any features that pop up in major/minor alternate features can be exchanged with anything listed in their respective feature type (major replaces major, minor replaces minor).                                                                     |
| Lore               | The shapes, sizes, ages, cultures, behavior, biology and origin of various races. Take what you like, scrap what you don't. The features of races are tailored to their themes, so deviating too far may be difficult. Do your best.                |
