You drink the blood of a creature, and your appearance morphs into that of the creature. You can choose to appear to be closely related instead.

This change does not give you any of the abilities that the creature has, nor does it change your statistics in any way (except for your [[Size and Reach|Size]], but not your [[Size and Reach|Reach]]). If you so wish, you can change only part of yourself into the creature, such as only your head, or only the backside of a centaur.
