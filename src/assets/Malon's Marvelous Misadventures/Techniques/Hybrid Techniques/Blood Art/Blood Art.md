Blood magic is a selfish, offensive set of abilities that focuses on vampiric effects and mutually assured destruction.

Blood isn't just an organic fluid - it is a fundamental force that is present in all living and unliving things. It is the physical counterpart to the soul, and as such, many Blood Arts deal [[Holy]] [[Damage]] as they split the opponent's blood and soul.
