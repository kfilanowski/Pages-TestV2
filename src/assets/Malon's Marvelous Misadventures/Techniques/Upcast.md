Many abilities, particularly [[Technique|Techniques]], become stronger or gain additional functions as you gain levels.

This is formatted as "Upcast X," where X is how many technique levels higher it becomes. Upcasting stacks (when applicable), allowing you to gain the bonuses repeatedly at regular intervals.

You do not need to have unlocked the higher technique levels in a given path to upcast a technique. You merely need to meet the level requirement for techniques of that level. Improvements to your [[CL]] can allow access to Upcast bonuses early.
