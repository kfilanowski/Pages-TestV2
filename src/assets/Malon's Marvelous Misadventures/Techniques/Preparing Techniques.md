When you have technique points invested in a specific style, you can prepare any of the techniques of the tier you have unlocked. [[Mana]] slots determine how many techniques you can have prepared or "memorized" at any given time and thus what you can use at a given moment.

All techniques are assumed to take 1 mana slot unless stated otherwise.

Abilities from items, classes, etc. do not take mana slots unless stated otherwise - see [[Innate Technique]].
