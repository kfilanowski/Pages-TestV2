Class and Weapon abilities are not true [[Technique|Techniques]], as they lack tiers (and thus do not scale with [[Upcast]]), and cannot be learned with [[Technique|Technique Points]]. They are very similar in function, however.
They are almost always [[Innate Technique|Innate Techniques]] gained through your [[Class]], [[Feat|Feats]], [[Magic Item|Magic Items]], and wielding [[Weapon|Weapons]] that have them.
[[Special Attack|Special Attacks]] also fall into this category.
They are written separately for cataloguing and reference purposes.

Weapon abilities often list compatibility, but these compatibilities are not immutable. Particularly powerful weapons may have seemingly incompatible abilities, to represent their unique position.
