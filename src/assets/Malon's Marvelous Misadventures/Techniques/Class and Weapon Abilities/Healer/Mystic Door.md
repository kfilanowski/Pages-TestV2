When you rest in a settlement of at least 100 people, you can mark one of the doorways, portals, or similar entrance in the place you rested as your Mystic Doorstep.

As long as you are within 10 miles of the place you slept, you can conjure a Mystic Door that links to the Mystic Doorstep for one minute. It is the same size as the entry you marked.

It takes one minute to cast. Any creature can take the portal back simply by walking through it, but it is one-way. Once the Mystic Door disappears, so does your Mystic Doorstep.

This effect does not require line of sight.
