Conjure a magic bow and make a [[Ranged Attack]] with 20ft range. If it hits, the target takes [[Holy]] [[Damage]] equal to [[Healing Touch]]. If this attack passes through allies, apply Healing Touch to them. 
This can be used through a [[Staff]]. 
This Ranged Attack counts as being made from a [[Bow]] [[Weapon]].
