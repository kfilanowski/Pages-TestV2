Psychomancy involves the use of mind magic to gather information and out maneuver foes before the battles even begin.
If it does come down to a fight, you can crush foes' minds or toss them around with [[Telekinesis]]. 
Long distance communication is made easy with spells like [[Dream]] and [[Sending]]. 
Creatures won't be able to keep secrets from you with access to spells like [[Detect Thoughts]] and [[Memory Movie]].
