You deliver a message to a creature over any distance, without [[Line of Effect]]. In order to communicate with a creature, you must have met them, and you must know their name.

When you cast the spell, you telepathically communicate simple ideas that require no more than two sentences to convey (Monsters are attacking the north gate. How do we respond?). Your target can reply with the same restrictions.

If your message is too complex or too long, the creature is dead, or the creature is on another plane, then the message gets lost in the ether and the caster takes 1 [[Psychic]] [[Damage]].

You can only cast sending on a particular creature once each day, or else it becomes [[Limited]].

[[Upcast]] 2 - Establish a link that lasts up to 10 Minutes, allowing free back-and-forth conversation. This makes the ability [[Limited]].
