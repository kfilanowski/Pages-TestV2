Throw an enormous ball of fire that explodes forcefully, dealing 3 [[SP]]+[[CL]] [[Fire]] [[Damage]] and [[Knocked Down|Knocking Down]] creatures struck ([[Reflex]] halves, and negates Knockdown).

You can target one specific creature with a [[Ranged Attack]]. If you land it, the creature's space is the center of the explosion, and it takes a -2 penalty to its save. If you miss, the fire falls directly down and then explodes when it first impacts a surface.

This also destroys flammable undergrowth, sends small objects flying, starts fires, disperses atmospheric conditions, and otherwise causes the effects one would expect from a fiery explosion.

[[Upcast]] 1 - +SP Damage, +10 Range, +5 Radius
