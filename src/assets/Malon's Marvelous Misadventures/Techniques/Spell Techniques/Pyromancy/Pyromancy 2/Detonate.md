An [[Ablaze]] target takes 2 [[SP]] [[Fire]] [[Damage]], the [[DC]] to save against the condition is increased by 4, and the penalty to [[AC]] is increased to -4. Only Standard Actions grant a new save against being Ablaze. If an effect would normally automatically remove Ablaze, it instead only grants a save without the -4 penalty.
