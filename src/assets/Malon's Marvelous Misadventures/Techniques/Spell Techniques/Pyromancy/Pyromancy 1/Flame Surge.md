You begin firing a constant stream of fire at a target. At the end of their turns, they take [[SP]]+[[CL]] [[Fire]] [[Damage]] and count as being [[Ablaze]] until the end of their next turn for the purposes of effects that call for it (it does not add additional damage).
If they leave the range at any point, the spell ends.

[[Upcast]] 2 - Can target one additional creature.
