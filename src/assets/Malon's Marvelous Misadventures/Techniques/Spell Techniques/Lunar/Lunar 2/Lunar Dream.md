This spell must be cast in the presence of moonlight.

You fall asleep, your body lifted into the air on a cloud of stardust.

Every minute, you regain 1 [[HP]]. After 30 minutes, you are restored to full HP. You also gain a new save vs any [[Poison]] and non-[[Curse]] spell effects. This counts as a [[Short Rest]], but you cannot eat to gain the benefits of [[Food]].

You are otherwise asleep as normal, and anything that would normally wake you up still can. This ends the spell early, denying its full effect.
