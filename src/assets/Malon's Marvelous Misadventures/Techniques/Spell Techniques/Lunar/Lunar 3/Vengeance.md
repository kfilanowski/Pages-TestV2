You may cast this spell in response to an [[Attack]], [[AoE]], or [[Targeted]] effect being declared on you, but before its result is known. You may also cast it at any point on your turn. Remind your DM to announce attacks before making them to make casting this spell less awkward.

You reflect 75% of the next instance of damage you take as [[Magic]] [[Damage]] back at the attacker. 

This spell is particularly easy to identify due to its distinct visual effect of a skull appearing over your head, making the [[DC]] to [[Identify Spell]] 10 points lower.
