Functions as [[Vengeance]], but on a creature other than yourself. It cannot be cast reactively.

You reflect 75% of the next instance of damage you take as [[Magic]] [[Damage]] back at the attacker. 

This spell is particularly easy to identify due to its distinct visual effect of a skull appearing over your head, making the [[DC]] to [[Identify Spell]] 10 points lower.
