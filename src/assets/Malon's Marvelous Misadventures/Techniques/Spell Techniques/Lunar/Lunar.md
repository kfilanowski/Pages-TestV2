Surrounding the magic of the moon are many Lunar Realms, ruled over by a single Lunar Kingdom. The magic of the realms themselves bestowed the royalty of the ruling class, with the Queen and King at the top being given unique wisdom and strength with which to lead their people.

The secrets to their magic were closely guarded by the royal family until the last King was murdered in a foreign adversary's coup attempt, and the princess at the time mysteriously disappeared for months. When she returned to take the throne back, she made the secrets of the Moon Queen's Wisdom public knowledge, but the secrets to the Moon King's Strength was forever lost when the Moon Princess died without providing the Lunar Realms a new heir.

These spells are based upon the Moon Queen's Wisdom. They focus on abilities passed down from the stars themselves that grant foresight, prosperity, retribution, and access to the ebb and flow of magic from heavenly bodies. Many offensive Lunar spells have delayed or indirect effects.

Some Lunar spells require access to the night sky.
