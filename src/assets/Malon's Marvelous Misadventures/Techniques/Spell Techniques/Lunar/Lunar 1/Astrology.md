When the spell is complete, you convert a scroll or parchment into a Horoscope. The target can read the Horoscope to gain insight into some of the strengths and failings they may have within the next 24 hours. As long as they have the horoscope on their person, they may add 2 to their [[Roll]] on a skill check. This cannot be used with [[Take 10]] or [[Take 30]]. After they use this benefit, the horoscope disappears.

A creature that cannot read cannot benefit from their Horoscope. A creature may only benefit from Astrology once per day.
