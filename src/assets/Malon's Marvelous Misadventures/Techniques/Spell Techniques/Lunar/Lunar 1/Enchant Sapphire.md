| Ring<br>(Accessory)     | You create a Ring of Recoil, which reflects 1 [[Magic]] [[Damage]] on every instance of damage to the creature that inflicted it, if any. Once it has reflected 40 damage, the ring disintegrates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Necklace<br>(Accessory) | You create a Necklace of Breathing, which automatically activates when you run out of breath, such as underwater or in outer space. As long as your airways are not obstructed, you can continue to breathe. Once activated, it lasts for 20 minutes, and then disintegrates.                                                                                                                                       |
| Bracelet<br>(Accessory) | You create a Bracelet of Artisanship, which reduces the Labor cost of something you're [[Crafting]] by 500 (maximum half of its original Labor cost). You must keep the item equipped until it is complete. When you finish, the bracelet disintegrates.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Tiara<br>(Headgear)     | You create a Tiara of Clarity, which allows you to Re-[[Roll]] a failed [[Will]] save against a [[Mind-Affecting]] effect. If you pass the Re-Roll, the tiara disintegrates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Jewel                   | You create a Distress Crystal, which sends a distress signal to up to 5 total friends and family members of your choice when you are Defeated, Dead, or fear for your life. They receive a brief telepathic message in your voice that describes your location to the best of your knowledge, and to please send help. They cannot respond to this message, and after the message is sent, the jewel disintegrates. |
