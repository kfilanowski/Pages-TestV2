You must have access to the night sky to cast this spell.

When the spell is complete, you create an object or small facility that meets the bare minimum requirements for a particular task, trade, or skill, such as a furnace for heating pottery or a lockpick. This item will break if used for anything other than its intended purpose, and disappears after the spell's duration or if exposed to sunlight.

You must create facilities that can fit within a 10ft cube. This spell does not provide fuel to run facilities. It may create objects with multiple parts, such as a series of vials and tubes for use in alchemy, but these cannot be separated from the facility without disappearing.
