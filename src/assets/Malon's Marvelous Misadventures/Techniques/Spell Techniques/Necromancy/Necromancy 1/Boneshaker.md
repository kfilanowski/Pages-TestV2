A successful [[Monster Lore]] identifies whether or not a creature has a skeleton if you are unsure.

A non-Undead target must save or take [[SP]]+[[CL]] [[Necrotic]] [[Damage]] and be [[Staggered]].

An [[Undead]] target makes a [[Charge]] [[Attack]] against a creature of your choice. An unwilling Undead may resist this with a save.

[[Upcast]] 1 - non-Undead targets take +1 SP Necrotic Damage.
