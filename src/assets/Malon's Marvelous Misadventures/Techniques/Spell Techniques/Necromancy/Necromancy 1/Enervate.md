You must be [[Drained]] to cast this spell.
Make a [[Ranged Attack]] against a target. On a hit, you transfer one stack of Drained from yourself to the target, and this ability is expended.

If you are not drained, this spell instead inflicts Drained 1 on you and heals for 5.

[[Upcast]] 1 - You can transfer an additional stack of Drained with the attack, or gain an additional stack of Drained and +5 healing from the self-targeted version.
