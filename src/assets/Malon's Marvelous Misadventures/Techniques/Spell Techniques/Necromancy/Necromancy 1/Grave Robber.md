You can sense the presence of corpses and tombs in range. When you see a corpse, you can tell what its name was in life. You can read faded writing on tombstones.

As a [[Standard Action]], you can pull a corpse from the earth, as long as it's not inside of a container.

Undead creatures of a lower level than yourself gain an aura in your vision.
