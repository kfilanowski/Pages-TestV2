You add an extra load to all mental actions related to a creature’s speaking, causing their speech to be slowed and slurred ([[Will]] negates). In order to speak at all, the creature must spend a [[Swift Action]] instead of a [[Free Action]] (For example, sharing information after using [[Monster Lore]]). In order to cast a spell that normally requires a Swift Action, the creature must spend a [[Standard Action]]. In order to cast a spell that normally requires a Standard Action, the creature must spend a [[Full-Round Action]].

This increase in action cost can reasonably apply to any other actions based on speech as well.
