Whenever you share information with a creature that it promises not to share (or a similar conditional offer of information and promised subtlety), you may cast this spell on them, which delays its effect until they break their promise.

If the target breaks their secrecy, the spell activates, and you can see through their eyes and senses for up to 10 minutes, after which the spell ends for good. 
At any point during those 10 minutes, you may end the spell prematurely to inflict 40 [[Psychic]] [[Damage]] on the target. This damage cannot kill the creature outright, but if it is [[Defeated]] by this damage, it gains the [[Placeholder]] [[Affliction]].

This spell does not stack. If multiple creatures use Confide on the same creature, it may only be affected by the damage once per day.

[[Upcast]] 1 - +20 Damage.
