You instantly [[Disguise]] the target creature, causing them to appear identical to you.

While standing adjacent to a creature that looks identical to you, [[Attack|Attacks]] and [[Targeted]] Abilities roll to randomly target among all adjacent identical creatures. Offending creatures get a [[Will]] save per attempt, and upon passing, they are immune to that instance of the spell.

[[Upcast]] 1 - Target one additional creature.
