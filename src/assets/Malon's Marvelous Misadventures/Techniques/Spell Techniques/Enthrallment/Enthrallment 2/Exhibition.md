| Target/Area | One Creature or Ally |

| Duration    | 3 Rounds or One Hour |
You cause all of the creature's equipment to visually disappear, making them appear naked or barely clothed (Will negates). 
For the duration of the spell, the creature acts as though it has no equipment, and cannot use anything dependent on equipment, such as shield actions, spell casting, and weapon special attacks. At the end of each turn, the creature gets a new save to end the effect.
They still get any passive bonuses to their equipment, such as AC from Armor and Shields.

When used on an ally, this spell lasts for one hour, but they are still able to use their equipment. Equipment in their hands is not affected.
