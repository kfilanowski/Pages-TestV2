You plant subconscious cues into a helpless or willing target. After completing the cast time, you cause the target to forget you casted this spell. At any point thereafter, you can trigger the true effects of this spell by speaking a passphrase in a manner where the target can clearly hear you as a [[Standard Action]]. For 1 minute, the creature aids you in combat, attacking your enemies as you direct them. Once this effect is triggered, the contingency ends.

The contingent aspect of this spell applies to the caster, not the target creature.

The spell leaves behind subtle cues, allowing those [[Proficiency|Trained]] in [[Insight]] to realize the creature is affected by this spell (Spell DC+4). Creatures only ever get 1 check to realize this enchantment is in place.
