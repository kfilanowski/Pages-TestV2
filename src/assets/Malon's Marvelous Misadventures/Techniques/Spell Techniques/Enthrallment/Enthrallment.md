Enthrallment spells focus on deceit, as well as mental domination of both overt and subtle varieties.

Most of this spell list was created by studying the abilities of Shira, a fiend lord Kitsune who stole Free Will from the world for her personal amusement. She is a master of subterfuge, and often exists among mortals, playing along with their politics and wars for fun. Being the least abrasive and the most approachable, Shira is the fiend lord the most mortals find intertwined in their life, often not knowing that they deal with a fiend. 

Over an enormous period of time, new fields of natural magic formed to fill in the void left by Free Will, such as a Vampire's ability to make thralls. Part of the spell list is sourced from the natural abilities of such creatures.
