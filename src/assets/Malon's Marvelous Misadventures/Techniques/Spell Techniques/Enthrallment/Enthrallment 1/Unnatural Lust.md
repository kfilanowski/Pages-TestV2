When you cast the spell, you choose two targets. The initial target is filled with lust. The second target doesn't get affected by anything, but rather determines where this lust is directed towards. The initial target must spend the entirety of its next turn moving towards the secondary target and then caressing, hugging, or kissing them (Will negates).

A creature gets a +4 to its save if it would not normally be sexually attracted to the secondary target. By succeeding on a [[Monster Lore]] check against a creature, you can determine what an appropriate secondary target for this spell would be.

After failing its save and satisfying its carnal desires, a creature becomes more resistant to the spell and always receives the +4 bonus on subsequent casts against it for one minute.
