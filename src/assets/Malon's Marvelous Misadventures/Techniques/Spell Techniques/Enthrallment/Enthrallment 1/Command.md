You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity ([[Will]] negates). You may select from the following options. 

Approach - On its turn, the subject moves directly towards you 30 ft and [[AoO|Provokes]]. It cannot use its movement beyond this.

Drop It - On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can’t pick up any dropped item on the same turn it drops it.

Kneel - The subject is [[Knocked Down]]. It may act normally, but takes any appropriate penalties. It may not stand up early.

Begone - On its turn, the subject moves 30 ft directly away from you and [[AoO|Provokes]]. It cannot use its movement beyond this.

Praise Me - The subject babbles on about your greatness, effectively leaving them [[Silenced]] for 1 round.

If the subject can’t carry out your command on its next turn, it defaults to Kneel.
