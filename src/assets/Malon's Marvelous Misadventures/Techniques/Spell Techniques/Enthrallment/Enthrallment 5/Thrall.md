| Duration    | Permanent                        |
Functions as [[Dominate]], but is permanent. The affected creature becomes a [[Companion]] and does not get new saves on its own.

If a friend, ally, respected superior, family member, or similar person of significance uses [[Aid]] on the creature, it gets a new Will save at -5. If at least three creatures spend their turn doing this at once, there is no penalty. Certain types of people, such as people related to the controlled creature's destiny or true love, can give them +5 on their save.
Successful [[Dispel]] attempts grant a new save.
