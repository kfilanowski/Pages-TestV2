You move around to inscribe a magic circle on the ground (up to 20 Ft Diameter), then infuse it with Mana to cause a tangible but transparent barrier to appear, sealing the [[Fiend]] inside of it. The Fiend is unable to pass through this barrier, or go under/over it. It is [[Anchored]] and [[Siphoned]] while inside. Otherwise, the Fiend may act as it wishes.

If the barrier is ever damaged from the outside, it automatically breaks, so care must be taken to protect trapped demons. The magic circle has 50 [[HP]] and a [[Weakness]] to [[Magic]] [[Damage]]. 

You may only trap a Fiend of a [[LV]] up to your [[CL]].

This spell is normally used to interact with the target safely, or to buy time while searching for a way to destroy it safely.
