Restore a creature's severed or damaged body part. If it has the body part on its person, this spell is a Standard Action, and [[Stunned|Stuns]] for one round as it is reattached and mended. If it does not have the body part, it takes 8 hours to cast this spell, and the creature is Stunned for the entire cast time.

Reattaching an appendage leaves a serious scar where it was severed. The target suffers the [[Placeholder]] [[Affliction]].

When generating a new body part, the new one will look smoother and be discolored. The target suffers the [[Placeholder]] Affliction.

The body part does not function until the associated Affliction is removed.
