You bind the target's soul, blood, and mana in place, which brings it back to life for 2 Rounds. It will die again when this spell ends, unless it is healed to 0 [[HP]] or higher, and the effects that killed it are removed (such as surgically reattaching/casting [[Regenerate]] on its head, or removing a death curse). 

You can cast this spell again if the target dies again, as long as you cast it within the time limit.
