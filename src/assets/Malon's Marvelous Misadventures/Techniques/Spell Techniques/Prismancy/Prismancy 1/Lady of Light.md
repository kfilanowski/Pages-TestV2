You shine with incredible light, clearly illuminating a radius of 60 with [[Light Level|Bright Light]], with a further 20 being [[Light Level|Dim Light]]. Despite this, the details of your form are still clear, though you lack shadows. You also radiate heat to anything nearby, hot enough to be toasty, but not hot enough to cause damage or ignite anything. You are protected from cold ambient temperatures.

You get -20 [[Stealth]] against creatures that can see, unless you are in an area that is brighter than you.
