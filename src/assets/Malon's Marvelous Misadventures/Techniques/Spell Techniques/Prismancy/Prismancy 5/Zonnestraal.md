| Effect      |                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Range       | -                        |
| Target/Area | 60 Ft Line, 10 Ft Radius |
| Save        | Reflex                   |
| Duration    | 3 Rounds                 |
You fire a beam of purifying light, dealing 7 [[SP]]+[[CL]] [[Fire]] [[Damage]] and [[Blinded|Blinding]] everything it hits for one round ([[Reflex]] halves the damage and negates Blinded). This automatically destroys objects of solid or lesser toughness, and if it's enough to break them, it continues past them. This damage area is persistent, and creatures that enter it must save against the damage. If the line impacts the ground or something it cannot destroy, it gains a 10 Ft Radius around the impact site in addition to the line.

[[Fiend|Fiends]] and [[Undead]] creatures that fail their saves are set [[Ablaze]].

You may not move while concentrating on this spell, and you do not fall if you are in the air. If you are moved against your will, the spell ends.

At the start of your next two turns, the damage occurs again, and you may sweep the beam up to 60 degrees (one hex direction) to target a new line and everything between the two lines that gets caught in the sweep. The sweep area is not persistent, but the new line is.

[[Upcast]] 1 - +1 SP Fire Damage.
