You create a zone that twists light and projectiles that appears as a giant mirror. Any creature that can see the mirror can use it to curve their [[Line of Effect]], and to determine [[Cover]], unlike a regular mirror. This also functions for projectiles and line attacks, as the mirror curves their trajectories towards whatever you see in the mirror.
