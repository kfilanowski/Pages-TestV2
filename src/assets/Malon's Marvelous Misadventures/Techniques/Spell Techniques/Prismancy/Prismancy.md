**Prismancy** sorceries are spells that focus on heat and light to inflict maximum damage as quickly as possible. Each spell channels the power of intense light, unleashing explosive projectiles, blinding flashes, and radiant energy capable of turning the world into a prismatic inferno.

This spell list was developed by Tiara Torneau, an Evocation Archmage renowned for her mastery over flames and light. Using her inherited powers over light, this hobby magic turned into a field of study that brought fire magic to the next level, incorporating auroras and the power of the sun to devastating results. Her goal of ending fights with overwhelming power were shared with the pyromancers of the time, resulting in a modern list that will tickle any blaster-caster's fancy of annihilation and enormous, flashy explosions, while maintaining the utility necessary for an adventuring sort.
