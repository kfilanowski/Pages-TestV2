This spell can be used in two ways.

Dispel - You [[Roll]] opposed [[CL]] to immediately end a magical effect. You must be aware of which effect you are specifically trying to dispel, as blind attempts at dispelling will fail. If you try dispelling magic you know is there but aren't aware of the properties, effects, or purpose of the spell, you take a -5 penalty.

Counter Spell - You Roll opposed CL to prevent a spell from being cast. This must be done as a [[Prepare|Prepared Action]] in response to a spell being cast. If the spell the creature is casting has a higher CL than your Dispel, they get a +5 bonus.

You can use Dispel on supernatural features, labeled (Su). The creature's CL is treated as (LV+2). Passive supernatural effects or constant innate spells can be reactivated as a [[Swift Action]].
