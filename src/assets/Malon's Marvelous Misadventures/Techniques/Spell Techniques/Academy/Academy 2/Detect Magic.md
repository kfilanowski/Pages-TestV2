While concentrating on the spell, you are detect the presence of magic in the area. This includes [[Spell]] effects, [[Supernatural]] effects, and magic items.
At first, you are only aware of the presence or absence of magic. After something remains in the cone for one full round, you can tell where it is located, and details such as how many magic effects are on a creature you can see. You can tell distinguished effects apart from the general noise of magical presence. 
This means that new magic that enters the area will be distinguishable from what you have already detected in the area. New magic must still be in the area for a full round to detect its precise location.
