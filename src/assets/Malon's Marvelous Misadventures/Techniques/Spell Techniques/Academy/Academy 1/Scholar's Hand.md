This spell has two uses, the first of which does not require the focus component.

You create a translucent hand that can pick up items and perform simple tasks, such as opening doors, pulling up pants, or tipping over buckets. It can carry up to 10 lbs and has a +0 bonus to [[Athletics]]. The hand can continue to act independent of you as long as you concentrate.

The hand can also write as you do, and can be used to write in or copy a book used as a focus, at a rate of about one page per minute.
