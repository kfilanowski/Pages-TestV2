You inscribe a magic rune on the surface of an object. Whenever a creature of at least tiny or larger [[Size and Reach|Size]] enters this area, the sigil triggers, creating one of two effects you decide upon casting. In either case, you are mentally alerted and awakened if [[Asleep]].

~={orange}Silent Alarm=~ - Only you are mentally alerted. 
~={orange}Loud Alarm=~ - A loud sound plays. Creatures within 300 ft can hear it in ideal conditions.

This spell only functions while you are inside its radius.
