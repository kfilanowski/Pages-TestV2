## Caster Level

Spells often include Caster Level as part of their total damage, or they may use it in calculating opposed checks, such as when dispelling. Martial Techniques can also use Caster Level as part of their damage, but it is much less common.

By default, your CL is equal to your [[LV]], and your spell's CL is equal to yours plus any bonuses you have to it, such as from [[Staff|Staves]] and [[Feat|Feats]].

Usually, the term refers to the effect's CL itself, not the user's personal CL. Usually, a creature's personal CL does not deviate from their level much, if at all. Therefore, assume any use of CL does not refer to personal CL unless otherwise noted.
