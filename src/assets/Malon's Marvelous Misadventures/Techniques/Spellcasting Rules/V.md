## Verbal Component

All spells have a verbal component. Verbal components cannot be whispered, and you must speak them clearly. Anything that prevents the mage from speaking prevents them from casting, such as being silenced.

The verbal components often contain a plain-language reading of the spell's structure or its name, in a [[Language]] known by the caster. When observing a caster using a language you understand, you need only have [[Arcana]] to identify it.
