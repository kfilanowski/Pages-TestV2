Spellcasting is a general title that applies to a specific type of magical effect, with specific rules. Spells do not encompass all magic, but it is the most common type. Most Spells are [[Technique|Techniques]].

All spells have some kind of visual effect associated with their casting before the effect occurs. Magic circles shining fingers and eyes, words manifesting into physical objects and circling the caster are all means to easily identify when a creature is casting a spell. The only exception to this is spells with the [[Subtle]] tag.

This is also the case for [[Innate Technique|Innate Casting]].

Spellcasting takes into account your [[CL|Caster Level]] and [[SP|Spell Power]], and requires using [[S|Somatic]], [[M|Material]], and [[V|Verbal]] [[Spell Components|Components]] (Innate Casting does not require components).
