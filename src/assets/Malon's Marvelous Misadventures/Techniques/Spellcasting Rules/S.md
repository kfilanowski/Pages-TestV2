## Staff Component

All spells have a Staff (S) [[Spell Components|Component]]. Disarming a mage of their staff prevents them from casting using it, and ends any spell they're concentrating on with it.

"Staff" components do not need to be exclusively provided by staves. Many other items, such as wands and seals, can also be used to serve the Staff component.

- [[Staff]] - Staves are usually long and sturdy pieces of wood. Most of the magical components of the staff are attached to the end of it. Staves can universally be used as weapons, and may augment specific kinds of spells.

- [[Seal]] - Seals have an enormous amount of variety to them. They are typically compact: Some small handheld object, often of spiritual significance. Seals are ineffective unless they are the only thing occupying the hand. Seals often alter the use of spells.

- [[Wand]] - Wands are usually small pieces of wood about in the rough shape of a pencil, but usually a bit larger. Wands are lightweight and easy to bring many of, and may grant additional spells prepared.

- [[Tome]] - Tomes, grimoires, or otherwise magical books can often serve as Staff components. They can be used to prepare spells you do not know, and must be in hand when used to cast said spells.
