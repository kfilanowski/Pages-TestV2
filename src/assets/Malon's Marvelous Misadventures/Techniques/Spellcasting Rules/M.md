## Material Component

Any spell with a Material [[Spell Components|Component]] has an item with a price associated with that is consumed on use. Anything with a Focus component has an item with a price associated that is NOT consumed on use.

You do not need to have these items in your hand - they merely need to be on your person to be used. They may briefly appear in the visuals of the spell or otherwise float out of your inventory as necessary.
