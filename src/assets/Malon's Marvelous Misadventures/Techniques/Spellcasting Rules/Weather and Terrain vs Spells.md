Certain high level spells manipulate the weather or terrain in drastic ways. If multiple casters attempt to cast different spells that affect the same weather, the higher [[CL]] always wins.

In the event where the caster tries to interfere with weather that is supernaturally powerful (created by natural magic, associated with cursed terrain, etc.), the [[DM]] should assign the effect an effective CL.

All weather-inducing spells do not function underground.

With smaller-scale terrain changes or unforeseen interactions between spells and an environment, an opposed CL check is more appropriate.
