You very briefly tend to yourself and focus, giving yourself half your [[HP]] in [[Temp HP|Temporary HP]], up to your total missing HP. This [[AoO|Provokes]] until the start of your next turn.

If used on an ally, you both must take the action, and you both Provoke.

This bonus HP lasts until you roll [[Initiative]] again.
