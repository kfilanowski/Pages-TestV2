| Range       | Weapon                 |

| Save        | -                      |

If you have a Ranged [[Weapon]] in hand, and you did not make any [[Attack|Attacks]] on your last turn, you can parry [[Ranged Attack|Ranged Attacks]] that enter your weapon's [[Close Range]]. Roll your [[ACC]] against theirs; if you exceed theirs, the attack is negated. You can parry an amount of times up to your weapon's [[AS]].
If you made fewer attacks than your AS on your last turn, you can use the unused remainder to perform this Technique.
