When targeted with a [[Spell]] or [[Supernatural]] effect, or when included in the [[AoE]] of a Spell, you can attempt a [[CL]] check to [[Dispel]] it and reflect it with a free hand. On success, it targets the caster, or is centered on the caster. For cone or line effects, the original cone or line reaches you, but is then extended with you as its origin and does not pass you.
