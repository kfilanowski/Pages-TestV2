Using a free hand, make a [[Thrown]] [[Ranged Attack]] that deals your [[Unarmed]] [[Attack]] [[Damage]] as a burst of air. Until the end of your next turn, you can tell their precise location as long as they remain within 60 ft of you. You are not effected by sight-based conditions they use, such as [[illusion|Illusory]] duplicates or [[Concealment]] when attacking them.

As an [[Instant Action]], you can [[Fly]] to the target and automatically deal a follow-up kick, dealing Unarmed Damage +d8.

[[Upcast]] 1 - +d8 follow-up damage.
