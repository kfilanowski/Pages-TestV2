| Range       | -          |
| Target/Area | One Weapon |
| Save        | -          |
| Duration    | -          |
When you are targeted with a Manufactured Melee [[Weapon]] [[Attack]], make an opposed [[Unarmed]] [[Attack]] [[Roll]]. If you beat the incoming Roll, you grab onto the weapon. This takes up your free hand.

You and the target cannot move away without someone letting go of the weapon. Whoever is hit by a [[Combat Maneuver]] during this automatically lets go.
