This technique must be used on a target that is below you, such as while falling from a higher place, or jumping at least their height.

Make an [[Unarmed]] [[Attack]] that, on hit, causes both you and the target to be [[Knocked Down]] in the same space. As long as you are Prone with them, they are [[Held Down]]. Moving into their space in this way does not [[AoO|Provoke]]. 

If they were already Prone, you [[Crit]] in addition to the above effects. 
Against an airborne target that is not adjacent to the ground, this does not cause you to be Knocked Down.
