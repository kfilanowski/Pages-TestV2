| ----------- | ------------ |
| Range       | Reach        |

| Duration    | One Round    |
Make an [[Unarmed]] [[Attack]] which, on hit, deals and launches the target into a distant location. They are treated as no longer being in combat (as they are in a distant location) until the end of your next turn, when they are [[Knocked Down]] in their original space and take 20 [[Crush]] Damage from the journey.

If the target is [[Defeated]] by this attack, they do not return, and are found d100 miles elsewhere.

If there is nowhere for the target to be launched (such as while underground), they are not removed from combat, and instead are instantly Knocked Down in their space while taking the extra damage.
