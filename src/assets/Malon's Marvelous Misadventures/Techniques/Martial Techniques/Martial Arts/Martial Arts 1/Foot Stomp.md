Make an [[Unarmed]] [[Attack]] in the form of a kick towards the opponent's lower limbs. They must be on or near the floor (such as by hovering).
On hit, they are [[Grounded]] for one round, and if they move away from you during this time they become [[Clumsy]] 4 (though, if you are forcible moved away or [[Prone]], they can move away without penalty).
