Martial Art [[Technique|Techniques]] focus on a devastating and clever suite of [[Unarmed]] attacks, each with its own tactical niche and dramatic flair.
While not as powerful as cleaving enemies in two or slinging balls of fire, these Techniques compensate with a variety of useful effects to disrupt enemies and close gaps in combat.

Unless otherwise stated, Martial Arts must be performed with Unarmed attacks.
