Throw a creature you are [[grab|grabbing]] at another. Both take 2d10 damage and fall [[Prone]]. The target gets a [[Reflex]] save to negate the effect. The thrown creature ends in an adjacent empty space closest to you. 
You do not need to target a second creature with this ability; you can choose to target any space.
This counts as a weapon with the Thrown property.

[[Upcast]] 1 - Damage increases by d10.
