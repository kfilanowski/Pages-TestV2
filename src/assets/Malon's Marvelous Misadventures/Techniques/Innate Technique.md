Some [[Technique|Techniques]] can be granted outside of the standard progression, such as when gained from [[Race]], [[Class]], magic item, specialized training, or a boon granted by another creature. Not all Techniques gained in this way are innate - these are much more common on monsters.

Innate Techniques acquired by players do not take up [[Mana]] slots and are always prepared. Monsters usually have their natural abilities represented by Innate Techniques, and as such are usually made with an amount equal to their Mana.

Innate Techniques grant creatures the ability to use Techniques without the usual requirements. Spells do not require the [[Staff]] component that other casting typically requires. If a spell has a material or focus component, that is also ignored with innate casting. Concentration spells can still be ended with a [[Disarm]] [[Combat Maneuver]]. Only one Concentration effect can be upkept in this way.

Unless otherwise specified, you cannot re-prepare limited innate techniques to regain their use.

If a creature's innate constant spell is deactivated, it can reactivate it as a [[Swift Action]].
