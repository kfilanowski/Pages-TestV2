A Technique is the form most abilities take. They are one of the major means of combat progression in the game. 

Techniques are often things that you use in combat, but many have out-of-combat uses as well. Spells may contain a greater portion of out-of-combat effects.

Techniques are either martial or magic, in the form of [[Spell|Spells]]. By default, non-Spell Techniques are [[Martial]]. 

In general, classes get access to a few technique trees. They gain technique points at odd levels, or may automatically get a specific tree at those odd levels. Techniques are separated into five levels, requiring 6 points of investment in order to reach the highest tier.

Every even level, you get a technique point you can invest into any technique path, separate from what you get from your class. For every point you invest, you get access to a new level of technique.

Technique levels have a hard character [[LV]] requirement when investing points to unlock more. At level 1, you can unlock the first tier, but every tier thereafter is available at every odd level, maxing out at tier 6 at level 11.
