[[Teamwork Feat]]
Requirement - [[Move As One]]

During an ally's turn, if they make a [[Charge]] [[Attack]], you can spend an [[Immediate Action]] to charge along with them and make a simple attack. You must charge attack the same creature they do.

Your [[Speed]] is zero on your next turn.

Turn based games make movement awkward, but the idea is you are moving together, so other positional effects, such as [[Escape Route]] or [[Shield Brothers]], can treat moving allies as within reach for the duration of the movement in circumstances where allies converge on a location or start in positions that are close to each other.
