[[Teamwork Feat]]

During an ally's turn, if they move, you can spend an [[Immediate Action]] to use your [[movement]] to move along with them. You must either end this movement within their natural reach, or threatening the same enemy as them.

You subtract this movement from your movement next turn.

Turn based games make movement awkward, but the idea is you are moving together, so other positional effects, such as [[Escape Route]] or [[Shield Brothers]], can treat moving allies as within reach for the duration of the movement in circumstances where allies converge on a location or start in positions that are close to each other.
