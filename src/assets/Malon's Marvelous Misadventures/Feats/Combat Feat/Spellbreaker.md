Combat [[Feat]]
Requirement: [[Arcana]] [[Proficiency]]

When striking a creature that is currently holding [[Concentration]] on a spell with a melee [[Attack]], they must make a [[Fortitude]] save or stop concentrating.

A [[Ranged Attack]] can be used as well, but the target gets a +4 bonus to their save.
