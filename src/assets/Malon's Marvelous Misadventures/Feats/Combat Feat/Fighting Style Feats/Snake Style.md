[[Fighting Style]] [[Feat]]

When a creature misses you with an attack, you can move 10 [[Elusive]] Ft closer to it. If this movement puts you within reach of the attacker, it provokes an [[AoO]]. This AoO must be an [[Unarmed]] [[Attack]].

When you would be hit with an attack, you can spend an [[Immediate Action]] to make an opposed [[Attack]] [[Roll]]. If you match or exceed their roll, you instead negate the attack, which activates the passive effect.
