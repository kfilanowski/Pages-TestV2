Combat [[Feat]]
Requirement: +1 [[STR]]

The first time you would be [[Defeated]] or outright killed in a day, you are instead not Defeated. If it was a result of taking damage, your [[HP]] is set to 1.

Whenever you are Defeated, you can make a single [[attack]] immediately before you are Defeated.

You automatically pass the [[STR]] [[Roll]] when [[Recovering from Defeat]].
