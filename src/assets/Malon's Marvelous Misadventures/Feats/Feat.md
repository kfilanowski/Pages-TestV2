Feats are class features in progression that are gained every odd [[LV|level]]. They allow your character to get bonuses to specific actions, abilities from other classes, and occasionally get general stat increases.

Some feats have prerequisites, such as stat requirements, [[Skill]] [[Proficiency]], or other feats. You must meet all of the requirements of a feat to take it.
