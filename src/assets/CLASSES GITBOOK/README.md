# Classes

Classes are the different types of characters you can play. Ill outline here what a typical class page looks like. Right here I give a brief description of the class.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Art" %}
This is where I put art I think showcases the class well. I include sources where possible and I draw a lot of it. Click the other tab!
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Basic Stats" %}
Here I include a chart that lets you know some of the important stats related to the classes. Each of these stats are described in the rules section.

| HP (martial)     | 20(+10 per level) |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Poise            | 8                 |
| Skills           | 4                 |
| Save Proficiency | Fort              |
| Memory           | 2+lvl             |
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## <mark style="color:green;">Level 1</mark>

Most characters will get their core abilities front-loaded at level 1. All classes get access to some type of techniques, whether its martial techniques or spells. Technique points granted through class usually have some form of restriction.

## <mark style="color:green;">Even Levels</mark>

Even levels are mostly dedicated to class features that directly increase the classes power. Access to new combat abilities, increasing the power of old ones, getting their own special attacks.&#x20;

## <mark style="color:green;">Odd Levels (post level 1)</mark>

Odd levels are mostly dedicated to getting the next tier of techniques. As such, class features are usually sparse. If any are included, they are usually minor increases in power or they are flavorful inclusions.\
You also get a feat every odd level.

## <mark style="color:green;">Level 11</mark>

Level 11 is an exception to the odd levels rule where most classes will earn some kind of capstone ability: Something that showcases mastery in whatever fighting style they possess. These features are usually purposefully designed to be overpowered and ridiculous.

## <mark style="color:green;">Level 12</mark>

Level 12 is the level where all player characters acquire ascensions. Ascensions are mostly class agnostic features that add a lot of customization to the final level in the game.\
Ascended characters are people that are incredibly significant to the world. These characters are the stuff of legend, and the abilities they acquire represent that. Their weapon becomes legendary, they become a demigod or they develop their own signature fighting style.
