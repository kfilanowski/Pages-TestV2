# Mechanic

Mechanics are engineers that put their heart and soul into their gadgets and gizmos, preferring one specific creation that they pilot into battle. They come in 2 main variants: pilots and suitors. Pilots are your typical mecha-style characters that hop into a larger robot and steer it around. Suitors have something more form fitting that augments their movement and fighting.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Technique Specialization (Martial)</mark>

You gain 2 technique points at level 1, then another point every 2 levels after.\
These technique points can be used on the marksman and  tree.

Characters with magical specialization gain points in wild card equal to their highest tier of magic technique and cantrips.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Greatest Creation</mark>

Mechanics start off with a specific type of mech, determined by archetype. The variety tends to come from how integrated it is into the mechanics themselves, such as a vehicle they pilot or a suit that augments themselves.

This mech can be sundered, lowering the DC of class abilities that are dependent on it by 2.\
When you are defeated, this mech becomes unusable and requires repairing. This requires a (30-engineering roll) minutes (minimum 1) and appropriate tools. If you ever lose this mech, you can recreate it in (30-engineering roll) days (minimum 1) and 200g of materials like metals and comfy leather seats.

Unless otherwise noted, all class features only function while mounted on mech.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Charge</mark>

Mechs have many powerful abilities that require the mechanic to gather power. This always has some kind of distinct audio and visual quality, such as revving engines, glowing chassis, steam erupting from every nook and cranny etc. You automatically fail stealth checks when charging, and creatures get a +20 bonus to perception to notice you when charging. Rolling initiative resets your charge, requiring you to charge again.

{% hint style="danger" %}
This mechanic (teehee) is designed to make it so you cannot use charge attacks on turn 1 of combat. Period. You can't use it as a surprise attack, preemptively charge and then enter combat etc. Hopefully this is airtight, but just in case, don't let players do this.
{% endhint %}

Charging is a free action, but you cannot use a charge move in the same turn that you charge. Vise versa is also true; you cannot charge right after using a charge move. This usually makes every odd turn a charge turn, and every even turn a charge attack turn, provided you have the actions and don't spend them doing other things.

{% hint style="info" %}
The terminology is a bit weird but there is a distinction between the class feature Charge and the general tag \[recharge]. These 2 things do not interact. The mechanic has many of both types of abilities and neither interact with each others cool downs.
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Skill</mark>

You get engineering as a bonus skill and a +4 bonus to it. \
Doesn't require mech.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Augment</mark>

Gain 2 augments, one of which uses the charge feature. Augments are customizable features that can give you new abilities, add additional limbs and enhance your physical abilities.

Gain an additional augment each even level.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Feat</mark>

Gain point blank master.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Scan</mark>

As a standard action, closely examine an object or creature within 30 ft to get a +4 bonus on knowledge checks related to it. You can choose to also lock onto them (if you're level 2).

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Lock On</mark>

You can choose a foe within 60 ft of as a swift action to hone in on a foe. Your attacks have seeking and you get a +2 bonus on attack rolls against this foe until you dismisses this ability (free action). You automatically know the position of the creature.&#x20;

You can automatically lock on to a creature you scan, regardless if you succeed on the knowledge check. This ability does not negate cover for the purposes of attacking this foe, but you are still aware of the foe's position until it moves at least 300 ft away from you.

You can lock on to only one creature at a time.
