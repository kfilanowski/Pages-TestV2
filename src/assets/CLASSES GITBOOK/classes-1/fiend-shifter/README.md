# Fiend Shifter

A Fiend Shifter is someone who has stolen the secrets to the powers of fiends, slowly letting this power overtake them. They only grow into a more terrifying monster capable of combating even the most terrifying the fiendish realms have to offer with the very same power they wield.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Technique Specialization</mark>

You gain 1 technique point in a tree (determined by archetype) this level and 2 levels after.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - The First Seal</mark>

You add fiend to your type, in addition to any others you possess.

As a free action, deal 1 true damage to yourself to break the first seal. This gives you bonuses based off your archetype. This lasts for 1 minute, or until you exit combat (or something similarly strenuous).

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Shifter Claws</mark>

You possess claws on your hands that you can use to make natural attacks. They deal 2d6 slashing damage if your hands are empty, or d10 if they are not. Any other natural attacks that you gain through this class share this damage, but often with a different damage type. These attacks can be used interchangeably with claws.

Your claws share the properties of a single weapon in your possession, such as magic enchantment, a magic focus' ability to cast spells, or special attacks. You can bond to a new weapon with a 1 minute ritual requiring concentration and contact with the weapon.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Multiattack</mark>

2 claw attacks.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Fiendish Growth</mark>

Gain a fiendish growth from your chosen archetype, or the universal list. Get another one at level 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - One of Us (Su) \[poly, true]</mark>

The physical transformation into a fiend shifter is a dramatic one that can draw unnecessary attention. You gain a specific form reminiscent of your original form that you can revert back to as a standard action. Breaking the seal or using a feature gained through fiendish growth ends this disguise.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Telepathy (Su)</mark>

You can speak directly into the minds of other creatures you can see. A creature must have an intelligence score of at least -2 in order to be telepathically communicated with. A creature can telepathically project its thoughts to several creatures in the nearby vicinity, even if it cannot see them. Once a creature initiates a telepathic conversation, the other creature can communicate back using telepathy. The creature that initiated the telepathic conversation can choose to end it whenever they wish.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Hell and Back (Sp) \[recharge]</mark>

You can innately cast the spell [Hell and Back](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/brazzeria/level-3/hell-and-back).

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Second Seal (Su)</mark>

You break the second seal, improving the ability that you gained at first level.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Shadow Realm (Su)</mark>

You can banish a willing or helpless creature to the realm of fiends. The creature is unable to return through any means other than a naturally existing portal. The Fiend Shifter can telepathically communicate with banished creatures. They can also stun themselves to observe them, as though floating overhead.

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Final Seal (Su)</mark>

You break the final seal, perfecting the ability that you gained at first level.
